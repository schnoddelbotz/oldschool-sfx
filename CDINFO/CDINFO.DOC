The program:

Main purpose is to download CD digital audio data straight from your
CDROM to your HARDDISK. Without any SAMPLING ERRORS/HISS/DESTORTION.
In FULL 16BIT, 44100 HZ STEREO SOUND.

    USAGE: cdinfo [-t] [-h] [-?]
    -t use text interface (graphical now default)
    -h use high sierra addressing mode (default red book)
    -rd debug info readlong request

Some docs:

How to save raw audio data to a WAV file:
press key 'w': The program asks for a starting sector (depending on using
Red book or High sierra addressing mode) and a ending sector.
If THERE IS NO ERROR (INDICATED IN THE BOX "Resultcode mscdex driver")
A FILE xxxxxxx.wav will be created. Faulty files will be deleted.

  xxxxxxx= HEXADECIMAL NOTATION OF STARTSECTOR

Example:
  1a14.wav

Format of the file: wav,16 bit 44100hz stereo

SOME TIPS/HINTS/DOCS:


----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The cdrom drive is capable of reading raw audio if the box
    'READING' show 'cooked + raw'. And of course if the mscdex &
    hardware driver supports it.
    NOTE: SOME CDROM DRIVES CAN ONLY READ RAW IN VERY SMALL CHUNKS
    (ABOUT 30 SECTORS) USE THE HIGH SIERRA MODE (-h) TO INPUT SMALL
    CHUNKS [FIXED IN VERSION 1.4]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Synchronizing errors can occur on a CDDISK which has BAD SECTORS.
    Nothing can be done about that, CDINFO tries 10 times to
    re-synchronize before stopping (reads on, wavfile can be used).
    Becouse CDDA-data has no sync info inclosed (only RAW 44.100 hz)
    you can not always predict if you have the right sector. That is why
    I use synchronizing.. BAD sectors give random data so with
    synchronizing you can not fix that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    TRACKS fields information:
    [start sector] [n (+/-)emp] [audio/data] [copy permitted?]

    start sector= highsierra or redbook address
    n= number of channels (2 or 4)
    + = with emphasis
    - = without emphasis

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Correct redbook address:
    min:sec:frame e.g. 1:20:56
    (0 < sec < 60)
    (0 < Frame < 75)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    QUIT = q or <ESC>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ACM = AUDIO CHANNEL MANIPULATION
    (when it is YES you can change volume/mixer settings, I hope)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The wav file is created with command [w] and has the name:
    (hexnumber of startsector).wav e.g. c213a.wav

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Debug info readlong (option -rd):
    a box will popup showing:
    readlong: start_sector num_secs_to_read (hex hex) total_secs_still_to_read (hex)

    'num_secs'= number of sectors (NOT SECONDS)
    these are the precise numbers given by the CDINFO.EXE to the MSCDEX interface.
    to look if something is wrong with CDINFO.
    * if they do not match the input you gave.. mail me.
    * if they do match something must be wrong with the mscdex interface..

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:
Not all cdrom can do raw reading!!
Do not use CDROM CACHING SMARTDRV with cdinfo!!

THANX FOR ALL THE FEEDBACK!...
see you in another production.

BTW: there is a small error in the graphic drawing (try to find it!) :)
