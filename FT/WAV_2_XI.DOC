2. MOTIVATION / WHAT FOR ?

If you often rip WAV's from CDs with CDINFO & Co. then this little tool is
for you! I wrote that because Jesus Villena's CONVERT 1.4b sometimes
produces nice crap (creates funny volume envelopes and loop points) and F.
Markus Jonsson's AWAVE (former 2PAT) can't export XI's nor can handle
wildcards.


3. FEATURES

   * NEW: "IDIOT mode", which means: 1:1 copy of the input waveform without
     cutting crap or making loops

   * NEW: auto"detects" looped sample done by COOL EDIT's script "crossfade
     full" or similiar ... NOTE: I DID THIS FOR !ME! and found it pretty
     usefull ... works as follows:

       1. check, if the first and the last sample of the waveform are
          nearly the same (5% tolerance actually)

       2. test, if these values are in the environment (3% actually) of the
          zero line, if YES, forget it (to avoid "false alarms" with proper
          waveforms, which starts and ends with a zero), if NOT, that could
          be a loop (remember: "-1" at the commandline as percent value
          removes all that "intelligence" ;) - converter will work in IDIOT
          mode)

   * NEW: can handle multichunks and variable header sizes saved by COOL95
     or AWAVE :-) ... OK ... lame, but try this with CONVERT14 :)

   * "Frequency to FT2 RelNote/FineTune conversion" - you will always find
     the original recording speed at "Q"-key, no matter what sampling
     frequency!

   * supports 8/16 bit mono WAVs

   * Zero Cross Detection - the exported XI will always start with a zero
     crossing

   * Conversion Start Trigger - conversion starts with the first sample
     which fits that minimum - to be exact: from the previous zero
     crossing, the process is as follows:

       1. The WAV file will be searched for the first sample-value which
          meets the via commandline-switch given minimum percent value

       2. From this detected point the file will be searched backwards till
          the next zero crossing

       3. If no zero crossing was found the forward search starts

       4. Now the conversion starts from that detected zero crossing


4. USAGE

WAV_2_XI wav-filename [percent]

   * wav-filename - must be there, wildcards allowed
   * percent - integer value -1, or between 0 and 100 (default = 5%),
     conversion starts with the first sample which fits that minimum - to
     be exact: from the previous zero crossing


5. EXAMPLES

WAV_2_XI *.* 0
     will convert all WAVs in the current directory and leave the sample
     data nearly unchanged (only zero cross detection)

WAV_2_XI *.* -1
     will convert all WAVs in the current directory in IDIOT mode - dumb
     1:1 copy of the complete waveform

WAV_2_XI *.WAV 100
     will convert all WAVs in the current directory with a maximum
     amplitude of 100% at the first value which meets this "minimum", if
     this full amplitude is never reached the maximum amp of the current
     file will be printed
