XM MOD DOS Collection - Backup of some old Music and Software

## WIP - Quickstart (Mac)

- Install [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) if not done before
- `brew install dosbox`
- Download the repository (use .zip if...) to e.g. ~/DOS
- `cd ~/DOS && dosbox .`
- At the DOS prompt, for example `cubic/cp` to start CubicPlayer

## Contents 

### MS-DOS Tools

- CubicPlayer
- FastTracker2
- Inertia

... wip/tbd :)


### MOD, XM Files 

Note CubicPlayer can play files directly off RAR archives,
so I just dumped them 1:1 for now. To get `rar`, read all
of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Roshal and then
and only then type: `brew install rar` and `rar x SOME.RAR` to
extract SOME.RAR's precious contents.


## License 

All work is (c) by their respective authors. This is just a public backup
of stuff downloaded from #BBS #BulletinBoardSystems in #Germany, back
in ~1995. Please get in touch should you want something removed.
I will fire https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/ instantly.
