HDDCHECK  is  a (very,  very) simple  but quite  useful DOS-Program to show the
actual free disk space of your HardDiskDrive(s).As I am a very bad programer, I
was unable  to  program this program  (?)  with command-line  options. 
This  is  why  you  received  (I hope so)  a  package with four files,

   HDDCHKX.DOC  this document
 * HDDCHK1.EXE  Version for one HDD with no other partitions *not released yet*
   HDDCHK2.EXE  Version for two HDDs or one HDD with 2 partitons
   HDDCHK3.EXE  2 HDDs/one of them with 2 partitions or 3 HDDs (?!)

if not, you really have bad luck....

Okay, HDDCHK  is quite useful to put into your autoexec.bat, so you are able to
see at each  startup, how much space  is still available. It also tells you how
much kB of Mainmemory is free. It just takes a few seconds at each startup, and
is  really  quite practical. I will soon realese a new version (possibly verion
0.9501 or 0.9502).  If you like the program,  you  don't  have to pay anything,
because  it  is -> FREEWARE. (Who in hell would pay for this program of SHIT?).

  Much fun, how I use to say, PÆµL......
