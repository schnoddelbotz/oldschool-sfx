These are the player specs for the REGISTERED VERSION of Descent 1.0... 
This WILL NOT work with the Shareware/demo version of Descent. I wrote this
because of the dramatic difference between saved-games of the registered 
version and the shareware version. 

I used Darren Lo's plrspecs, for the shareware version of Descent, as a 
referrence guide. This was to keep my sanity.

[DISCLAIMER....]
You should only use this if you want to hack your .sg0, .sg1, etc, saved-games 
(ie. if you don't know how to or what is hex editing, please forget that you 
ever saw this [unless you like to screw up your files]).
