godlike.hex.reg.dcnt.zip contains: dcntspec.doc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is for people that would like to cheat at the Registered Version
of Descent. This file contains hex addresses that apply only to the
registered version. 

This is basically a follow up to my descent.godlike.plr files you may have 
seen. You may have been disappointed to find out they didn't work. More than 
likely it is because that file will ONLY patch the shareware version of 
descent. So, if you are sad, stuck on a level, and know how to hex edit 
... then you are in luck. Now you have the dcntspec.doc.

What? You don't know how to hex edit!? That's okay, look for ...

Raymond Leach's "dplredit"	or
Andrew Pye's soon to be released "DSGE" for the Commercial Release of 
Descent.
