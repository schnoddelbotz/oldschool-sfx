     I created this level due to the response I got to my level Tribute. 
I had several people asking for another fast moving level that had the same 
"able to get out of anywhere" feel of most of my levels. So....I created this 
level. I added some areas and features that I found were really fun in some
of the other levels that I have created. This level should run REALLY smooth
on any machine and should be a blast with only two players and total and 
absolute chaos with 3 or more.....I hope you like it.
                                HAVE FUN!!!!!

Thanks, as always, to Argon*Paladin for his kindness and patience. Thanks to  
the whole KALI crew.....you know who you are! Thanks also to PooterMan for
posting my levels and taking the time to maintain such a great page filled 
with neat stuff.

This level was created using beta version 0.9a of the Descent Mission Builder 
for Windows.

PS. I love Jennifer.
