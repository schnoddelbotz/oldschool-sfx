This is a quick and dirty hack to make DESCENT2 run without its CD ROM in
the drive.  This makes NO modifications to Descent II and was not made using
any reverse engineering of D2 code.  All it does is emulate Microsoft's
published specifications for MSCDEX.

To make this substitution work, you must make a disk that looks like the descent
CD ROM.  This can be a floppy, a hard disk partition, or anything you can set
the volume label on. (This makes direct substitution of a Novell volume
difficult.)  For local drives this is trivial.  First make a D2DATA directory
off of the drive that will emulate your CDROM.  This can be empty.  Second,
set the volume label to DESCENT_II.  Lastly run FAKED2 followed by the drive
you just set up.

If you are running from the same drive as you set up you will get a message
saying you can't run Descent from the CDROM.  To fix this use the SUBST command
to make a duplicate of the drive.  Example, to duplicate drive C on drive E
use the command "SUBST E: C:\" before running FAKED2.

Example for faking drive A:

A:
MD D2DATA
LABEL DESCENT_II
FAKED2 A:
C:
CD GAMES\DESCENT
D2

Example for faking drive C:

C:
MD D2DATA
LABEL DESCENT_II
SUBST E: C:\
FAKED2 E:
CD GAMES\DESCENT2
DESCENT2

First warning - This may not work under Windows.

Last warning - If MSCDEX is not present, attempting to use Redbook audio could
cause weird stuff to happen.
