Description             : An awsome small level for DOOM ][ with a
                          Peace sign and a Ying-Yang on the floor.
                          (Just thought I would be different)
                          Designed for DEATHMATH.
                          Their is no end to level so don't look for it.
                          I did that to to keep the snoops from accidentally
                          passing the level. (Man does that piss me off)
                          Great with ALTDEATH
