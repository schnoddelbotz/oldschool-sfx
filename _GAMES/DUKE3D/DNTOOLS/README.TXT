DNGrab V1.0 :
--------

DNGrab is a utility to read all files in "DUKE3D.GRP" and to save them in
the same directory. DNGrab expects to find "DUKE3D.GRP" in current directory.




DNMake V1.0 :
--------

DNMake is a utility to create a new "DUKE3D.GRP". All files in current
directory will be moved to "DUKE3D.GRP". If "DUKE3D.GRP" already exists,
it will be overwritten. So be sure that there are the right files in current
directory and keep a copy of "DUKE3D.GRP" elsewhere !
