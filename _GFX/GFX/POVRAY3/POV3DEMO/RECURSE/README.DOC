This directory contains some variations on the theme of a Menger sponge.  The
implementations are recursive to an arbitrary depth.  This is done by having
a file #include itself.  The different implementations demonstrate tradeoffs
between parsing and rendering times, code size and corresponding speeds, and
ways of modeling the sponge.
