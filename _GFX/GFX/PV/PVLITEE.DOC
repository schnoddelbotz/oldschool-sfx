2. Requirements
----------------
You need an AT compatible computer with an EGA, VGA, SuperVGA or 8514/A 
compatible graphic adapter. Your computer should have a hard disk and at least
512KB RAM. 
sizes.
PVLITE supports SuperVGA with ATI, Paradise, Ahead, Video7, OAK, Chip & 
Technology, ET3000/4000 and Trident 8900 chipsets in nearly all resolutions
up to 1024x768x256.
PVLITE is generally successful in detecting the chipset, but you can also use
command line parameters to configure PVLITE to the display functions.
PVLITE works with very large images up to 10240x10240. It shows an overview or
extracts a section if the image can not be completely displayed.
All VGA's are supported by two special resolutions 360x512x256 and 720x512x16.
VGA's with the new VESA conventions are supported via the VESA-calls.
8514/A, Tiga and XGA often offer a AI interface. If it is installed it is
automatically supported.
The CEG-multicolor DSP is supported for the use with CEG images but you can
also display and convert them even without this feature.     
ATI ULTRA 2MB with MACH32 Chip is supported with 32768 colors and 65536 colors
(5-6-5 mode) and truecolor.
The HiColor RAM DAC is supported with 32768 color mode for the use with any
image that contains more than 256 colors.


3. Configuring the graphic adapter
---------------------------------- 
If PVLITE is called without parameters, it tries to find the adapter installed in
your system. If this does not work reliably, you have to call PVLITE with command
line parameters. The parameter that defines the type of adapter must be the
last one:

$10000 = ATI,  $20000 = VIDEO7,   $30000 = ET3000,  $40000 = ET4000,
$50000 = PARADISE(WD),  $60000 = TRIDENT8900,  $70000 = AHEADB,
$80000 = CHIP&TECH,  $90000 = OAK,   $A0000 = AHEADA,  $B0000 = EVEREX,
$C0000 = VESA,  $D0000 = Genoa,   $E0000 = NCR,   $F0000 = Realtek.

If you don't know your type or if the display does not show correct images,
you can try the parameter $C0000 for VESA. This allows type independent
access if your VGA supports the VESA interface. You might have to load a
TSR utility like VESA.COM from your VGA disk before you start PV.

PVLITE automatically supports the following resolutions on VGA's with 512kb/1Mb
Video RAM:

-  640x480x256
-  800x600x256
- 1024x768x256/16

PVLITE chooses the appropriate resolution but you can also force a resolution by
toggling the 'X' key. The resolution is displayed in the last line of the
menu. If you want to add any other mode you just have to add the function
number to the last parameter (remember it's a HEX code!). You can find it in
your VGA reference manual.

 eg    PVLITE /e $10065  or  PVLITE $65       = 1024x768x16 with older ATI Wonder's
       PVLITE $nn6f02                         = VIDEO7 Mode nn
       PVLITE /x /e $30                       = ET4000/3000 1024x768x16
The parameter /e stands for 16 color modes.

If PVLITE does not find the mode it tries 360x512x256 for color images or
720x512x16 for monochrome images.
You can force these modes by adding $f2 or $f3 to the command line.

This should run on all VGA's but not on EGA. In this case try PVLITE /x $12 for
640x480x16, PVLITE /x $10 for 640x350x16, PVLITE /x $13 for 320x200x256, or any
function number listed in the adapter's manual.

The parameter /x means that PVLITE uses that mode only if required.
Eg : PVLITE /x $65  - this is for older ATI-Wonders that have the function $65 for
1024x768x16. The default for PVLITE is $55 for newer ATI Wonders.
If PVLITE does not find the $55 mode it then calls $65 from the command line.
Be sure you give a valid function number. Otherwise PVLITE ignores your input,
and automatically switches to conversion mode.

- 8514/A, TIGA and XGA are supported if the AI is loaded (HDILOAD, 8514AI,..).
Work stations and graphic adapters with 1MB & TIGA often offer a 8514/A 
emulation. If you use it you will have 640x480x256 and 1024x768x256 display
modes. You can select them using the command line parameters $17f or $27f.

- 1280x1024x16/256 and 1600x1280x16/256 are provided but not tested yet.
If your adapter supports such resolutions try out the mode by using the
command line parameter. If you use the AI you can try $37f, $47f .. $f7f.

- Truecolor, Hicolor
  ATI Ultra with Mach32 and 2MB are supported in the 'ATI VGA Auto' mode with
  16,8 Mio. and Hicolor (65536) automatically in the following resolutions:
  640x480x24Bit, 800x600x24Bit, 1024x768x16Bit.

  VGA's with VESA1.0 Hicolor Modes (65536, 32768) do not have unique
  function numbers. If you know the number of the function you can use
  it by calling PVLITE with that number (e.g. PVLITE /x $117  with ATI, PVLITE /x $302
  with  Diamond Stealth). VGA's with VESA1.2 should work fine without adaptions.



4. Commandlineoptions
----------------------
  PVLITE [Path[Name.ext]] [-k /o /h /p] [$nn (VGA-Mode)]');
  -k = shortens the delay befor the image is displayed.
  /p = no coloroptimizing. Images with more than 256 colors are normaly reduced
       to a optimum set of colors with 256 color VGA's. This takes a lot of time.
       but the result is better. If you prefer a faster output and a primitive
       display quality take /p.
  /o = disables the usage of Hicolormodes.
  $nn  is the last parameter and it defines the VGA type or forces the VGA mode.


5. Installation, Registration
-------------------------------
The registered version shows the Name of the User.

The shareware-version makes additional waits with big images.
And it may not be used comecialy witout registration.

The registered user should inform in the Ultraforce BBS or via FIDO to new
versions. I do not send automatically updates. please order them.
If you wish I can include Functions and imageformats
(it depends of the amount, it may be you pay the additional developments).
