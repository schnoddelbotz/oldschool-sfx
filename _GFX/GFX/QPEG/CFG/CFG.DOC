
    QPV/386 configuration files
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This textfile is intended to be read by people who want to create their
own configuration file or modify existing configuration files.
You normally needn't do that, just pick the configuration file for your
graphics card.  For more information please read the file INSTALL.DOC
(directory ENGLISH).

Before making any changes to QPV.CFG files, please read these
instructions carefully.

The QPV.CFG files define all available video modes that are used by
QPV/386.  You may edit it with a standard ASCII text editor (for example EDIT
which is distributed along with MS-DOS 5/6).  If you want to make changes,
you should have some fundamental knowledge about your video modes.  Most
VGAs come with a manual which contains at least a list of available
modes and their corresponding mode numbers.  If you can't get certain
modes to work, send me a letter or electronic mail, and I'll try to help
you (of course I'll try harder if you're a registered user :-).
However, there's no guarantee or obligation of any kind for me.

Comments in QPV.CFG are preceded by either '#', ';', or '%'.
Empty lines are ignored.

The first line (not counting comments, of course) defines the type of your
video card.  This is the format of the first line:
   type order
'type' and 'order' must be seperated by at least one space.

'type' denotes which of the driver files will be used.  For example,
if you specify 'ET4000', there must be a file ET4000.DRV.
'order' must be either 'RGB' or 'BGR'.  It specifies the byte order in
true color modes (24 bit).  If you're not sure about the order, try both,
either 'RGB' or 'BGR' will give you the correct colors (if, for example,
skin looks blue, try the other option).
If you don't have a true color card (i.e. no 24 bit modes), the value of
'order' doesn't matter (though it must be specified).

All subsequent lines define the video modes available with your card.
This is the format of each line:
   width height colors line ax bx options
All items must be seperated by at least one space.

'colors' must be one of the following:
 -  '16': 16 colors (4 bit), greyscale display only
 - '256': 256 colors (8 bit), greyscale and dithered color display
 - '32K': 32 K colors (hicolor, 15 bit), color display
 - '64K': 64 K colors (hicolor, 16 bit), color display
 - '16M': 16 M colors (truecolor, 24 bit), color display
'line' specifies the amount of memory used for a single row of pixels.
This is usually the width multiplied by the number of bytes used to store
a single pixel.
'ax' and 'bx' specify the register values for interrupt 10h.
For standard modes, ax is the mode number, and bx is 0.
'options' (optional) is zero, one, or more of the following characters
(not seperated by spaces!):
 - 'C': clear video memory (some SVGAs don't clear the screen at a mode
        set, in this case use this option for the relevant mode).
 - 'R': Reinitialize video mode instead of clearing the video memory
        (this shouldn't be necessary for most cards).
 - 'D': debug mode (for testing purposes only, not intended to be used
        by the end user).
 - 'M': this option might be necessary for the true color mode of the
        MegaEva 1024-S.
 - 'H': only necessary for 64K hicolor modes on ET4000 based cards,
        it switches the ET4000 BIOS from 32K to 64K mode.
 - '3': 3 bytes per pixel in truecolor mode.
 - '4': 4 bytes per pixel in truecolor mode.  If neither '3' nor '4' is
        specified, QPV/386 will try to autodetect the number of bytes per
        pixel (which is usually correct).

Values for 'width', 'height', 'line', 'ax', and 'bx' are in decimal.
You can use hexadecimal notation by preceding the values with a dollar
sign '$', for example '$10f0'.

IMPORTANT:  Using modes that your hardware (graphics card and/or monitor)
can't handle can damage your hardware!  Be sure to use only supported
modes.  If you come across a mode which looks flickering or unstable
(i.e. the monitor can't hold the picture), abort QPV/386 immediately and
delete that mode from the configuration file.

YOU ARE USING QPV/386 AT YOUR OWN RISK!  THE AUTHOR (OLIVER FROMME) IS NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE USE OF QPV/386 OR BY THE INABILITY
TO USE QPV/386.  IF YOU ARE NOT SURE ABOUT THIS, OR IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT THIS,
THEN DO NOT USE QPV/386!

QPV/386 is inexpensive shareware.  If you continue using it after a trial
period of 30 days, you are encouraged to pay a small registration fee.
The source code of the JPEG decoding routines is also available.
For more details please read the documentation of QPV/386.
