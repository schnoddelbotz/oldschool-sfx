To get QPV/386 working for your graphics card, follow these steps:

 1. Run the setup utility by typing 'SETUP'.  Select your graphics card from
    the list that is displayed.

 2. You should then browse through the configuration file QPV.CFG which
    has been created/modified by the setup utility.  Read the comments and
    check if everything looks okay.  (The configuration file is located in
    C:\QPV/386 if you run QPV/386 from a non-writeable media, for example
    from a CD-ROM.)

 3. Run QPV/386 by typing 'QPV/386'.  Try viewing images using different
    video modes.  If everything works fine, sit back and relax.

Some Hints:

 - Some questions about configuring QPV/386 are discussed in the FAQ.DOC
   file.  Please read it if you have problems configuring QPV/386.

 - If you can't get a video driver to work, try to select VESA.
   If your VGA BIOS hasn't embedded VESA compatibility, you have to install
   a VESA BIOS extension (VBE) before starting QPV/386.  Most graphics cards
   come with a VESA VBE/TSR (please refer to your card's manual).
   Please read the file FAQ.DOC for more information about VESA.

 - Experienced programmers can write their own video drivers.  Please read
   the file DRVSRC\DRV.DOC for more information.
