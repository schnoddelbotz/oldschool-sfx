
What is PicDex?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IMPORTANT:  PicDex is NOT available yet.  Read on for further information.

PicDex is a program which enables you create index images (sometimes called
"contact sheets") of any number of images.

In other words, PicDex reads several images, reduces them in size, and puts
them together into a new image.  The file name is written below each mini
image.

The combination of PicDex and QPV/386 is an excellent tool to maintain
large image archives -- ideal for BBS, Mailboxes, FTP servers, online
graphics services etc.  Of course it is possible to create index images
of index images.  You don't need QPV/386 for PicDex (and vice versa),
but together they form a powerful team.

PicDex offers a mouse driven and windows oriented colorful graphical user
interface (state-of-the-art GUI) -- you'll love it.  Many options enable you
to influence PicDex and get the result you want.  Using PicDex is fun!

PicDex can read all the file formats which QPV/386 can read (currently JPEG,
Targa, GIF, PCX and BMP).  The index image which is generated by PicDex can
be written in all those file formats, too (including JPEG!).

For size reduction, PicDex doesn't just leave out pixels.  Instead, it uses
a linear interpolation which makes the shrunk images look smooth and clean.
So many images can be put into a single index image, while you still can
recognize the images' contents.  Nevertheless, PicDex is fast (well, I'm
the author of QPV/386, so I really needn't mention that).

The system requirements are similar to those of QPV/386:
 - 80386 processor or better (386SX is sufficient)
 - VGA graphics card (standard VGA is sufficient).
 - XMS and/or EMS memory.  The amount depends on the size of the index images
   you want to create.  For example, a color image of 800x600 pixels takes
   about 1.5 Mb (greyscaled only 0.5 Mb).  You can use PicDex with less
   memory, but then the harddisk will be used to store temporary data, thus
   making PicDex much slower (I mean REALLY much slower).
 - About 500 - 550 Kb free conventional base memory.
 - You absolutely must have a mouse, because PicDex can NOT be controlled
   by the keyboard only.
 - MS-DOS 5.0 (or better).

PicDex price list:

   unregistered shareware version:     5 $US,  5 DM   (outside Europe 10 DM)

   single private licence:            20 $US, 30 DM
   ditto, for regist. QPV/386 users:  15 $US, 20 DM   (until 30.6.1995 only)
   ditto, package PicDex + QPV/386:   35 $US, 50 DM   (until 30.6.1995 only)

   single commercial licence:         40 $US, 60 DM

The shareware version contains all the features of the registered version.
It can be used for 30 days max, then you have to register (or stop using
it, but I don't think that you want to do that).

Mailboxes which can be used freely need a private licence if they want to
improve their image archives using PicDex.  Commercial services and
Mailboxes which ask for usage fees need a commercial licence.
Please ask for bulk discounts and prices of group licences.

Orders for PicDex are already accepted, but it can be delivered in about
three months, because some of the planned improvements have still to be
implemented.  Besides, PicDex is going to undergo an intensive betatesting
phase, to avoid bugs and inconveniences.  (Betatesters have already been
selected, so please don't ask me for a beta version.)

For ordering PicDex you can temporarily use the order form of QPV/386
(please indicate that you want to get PicDex).
