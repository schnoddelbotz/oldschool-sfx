modes.  If you come across a mode which looks flickering or unstable
(i.e. the monitor can't hold the picture), abort QPV/386 immediately and
delete that mode from the configuration file.

What is QPV/386?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Quick Picture Viewer /386" (hereafter referred to as QPV/386) is a
viewer for JPEG image files.  It is about twice as fast as other common JPEG
viewers.  Compare it yourself, you'll be surprised.

JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group, pronounce "Jay-Peg") is an image file
format which uses a "lossy" compression.  JPEG images (they have usually a
"JPG" file extension) are normally very small and offer better compression
than any other image format.

Decoding of JPEG images is a rather complicated process, thus it needs a lot
of computing power and performance.  QPV/386 takes advantage of the advanced
features of 80386, 80486 and Pentium (586) CPUs, and it uses large look-up
tables instead of formulas.  Well, I don't want to get into details.  It's
fast, that's all you could want to know.


Features
~~~~~~~~

 - It's fast (have I mentioned that before?).
 - Uses advanced features of 80386/486 processors (note, the Cyrix 486DLC
   is only an improved 386 rather than a 486).
 - Contains Pentium optimized code.  QPV/386 is immune against the
   FDIV bug of Pentium processors.
 - Nice preview ability which is even faster (lets you quickly browse through
   lots of images, very useful if you're searching for a certain image).
 - Works even with a standard VGA card (320x200x16, 640x480x16, 320x200x256).
 - Supports many SVGA cards (virtually all with VESA capability).
 - Uses truecolor (16M color), hicolor (32K color), 256 color (either
   greyscale or dithered color), and 16 color (dithered greyscale) modes.
 - You can pan across an image which is bigger than the current screen
   resolution (scrolling).  Some XMS and/or EMS memory is needed for this.
   You can even pan using your mouse, which is much fun (at least on fast
   local bus machines).
 - You can change the resolution without loading/decoding the image again
   (this is restricted to the same color resolution, for example you can't
   switch from hicolor to truecolor without reloading the image).
 - Supports the following image file formats (more to come):
    * JPEG/JFIF (see below)
    * GIF:
       + interlaced and non-interlaced
       + GIF87a and GIF89a (87a subset only)
       + displays the first image of a multi-image GIF
    * Targa (TGA):
       + truecolor (15, 16, 24 and 32 bit), greyscaled, or with palette
       + uncompressed or rle compressed (run length encoded)
       + supports all video modes (16, 256, 32K, 64K, 16M)
    * PCX:
       + 1 and 4 bit with standard palette
       + 8 bit with extended palette
       + 24 bit truecolor
    * BMP (Windows)
       + 1 bit monochrome with palette, uncompressed
       + 4 and 8 bit with palette, uncompressed or RLE4/8 compressed
       + 24 bit truecolor, uncompressed
    * BMP (OS/2)
       + 1, 4 and 8 bit with palette, uncompressed
       + 24 bit truecolor, uncompressed
       + also supports the new multi image format (BA-BMP)
    * IFF/ILBM (LBM)
       + 1 to 8 bit with palette, and 24 bit truecolor, also DP2 enhanced
       + uncompressed or compressed (ByteRun-1)
       + no HAM yet (due to lack of test images)
    * PNM
       + PBM (black/white), PGM (grey), PPM (truecolor)
       + ASCII and raw/binary versions
    * Photo-CD
    * PNG ("ping")
       + complies with the recommendations of the PNG specification
         (draft #9, 7-March-1995)
       + supports interlacing, alpha and transparency.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - 80386 or better CPU (33 MHz or faster recommended), 386SX is sufficient
 - VGA graphics card (SuperVGA recommended, though QPV/386 will run on any
   standard VGA card)
 - some XMS and/or EMS memory (depending on the size of the images), though
   QPV/386 will also run without any XMS/EMS, but then you will be unable to
   do any panning/scrolling
 - about 500 to 550 Kb of free conventional memory
 - MS-DOS 5.0 or compatible operating system

A mouse is not required, but it's much more fun than keyboard control!

A numeric coprocessor is not required.  If present, it will not be used,
because it would not speed up decoding/displaying.


Using QPV/386
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At first you have to configure QPV/386 for your video hardware by running
the SETUP utility once.  Please read the CONFIG.DOC file for more
information.

Then just type 'QPV/386' to run it.  There are some command line options
(type 'QPV/386 /?' to get a help message), but they're usually not needed.

The graphical user interface of QPV/386 is rather intuitive, so there is no
need for much documentation.  Press the 'F1' key to get a list of all
keyboard functions.  Hit '?' to get a list of keys that can be used while
viewing an image.  You can quit QPV/386 at any time by pressing Alt-X.

QPV/386 can also be used as command line viewer (without graphical user
interface).  Type 'QPV/386' followed by one or more filenames.  Wildcards
('*' and '?') are allowed, too.  Type 'QPV/386 /?' for more information.

Experienced users should have a look at the initialization file QPV.INI.
It offers many possibilities to change QPV/386's behaviour, you can even
enable some advanced features which are disabled by default (e.g. automatic
video mode selection).  It's a standard ASCII text file, containing
detailed comments for each topic.
Some of these setting can also be changed while QPV/386 is running:
press Alt-O (while the directory listing is displayed) to enter an options
window.


Restrictions and Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QPV/386 can't handle all kinds of JPEG images.  Specifically, it can only
decode files which comply with the JFIF standard.
See 'Technical Information' below for more details.

The maximum image width is 4000 pixel.  QPV/386 will refuse to decode larger
images.  The image height is not limited, but if it's too large it may not
fit into memory (XMS/EMS), thus you can't see the bottom part when scrolling
down.  If this happens, try to use a video mode with less colors, because it
needs less memory (see FAQ.DOC).  Or buy more memory :-)


How to get an updated version of QPV/386
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to the UPDATES.DOC file.


Revision history and changes from prior versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to the CHANGES.DOC file.


Technical Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QPV/386 can decode greyscaled images (containing a single component using
h1v1 upsampling) and YCbCr true color images (containing three interleaved
components in a single scan, using either Yh2v2, Yh2v1 or Yh1v1 upsampling
for Y and Ch1v1 for Cb/Cr), covering virtually all JFIF files in use today.

QPV/386 can handle files that contain restart markers, but it will not use
them for error recovery.  QPV/386 can also display JPEG files which were
created with the 'Adobe Photoshop' (at least version 2.5).

The basic JPEG decoding routines are written in pure 386 assembly language,
everything else is written using Borland Pascal 7.0.  I am not using
protected mode, because it would slow down the decoding rather than speeding
it up.  I have linked the JPEG routines into a single easy to use Pascal
unit, which can also be used within other applications.  If you want to
purchase the unit, please read the file REGISTER.DOC for more information.

The JPEG unit provides procedures to open and close a JPEG file, read the
file header, and read the image row by row.  It contains routines which
return the lines as 24 bit true color RGB/BGR, 15/16 bit hicolor, 256 color
dithered, 256 color greyscaled, 16 color grayscaled/dithered, and 16 color
greyscaled/dithered for preview (scaled to one eigth or one fourth).

A DLL library which can be used for Windows and protected mode applications
is under development and will be available soon.
