This file answers the following questions:

 - What to do if you want to register
 - How to pay the registration fee
 - How to get the JPEG Unit / the source code


Why should you register?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   QPV/386 is shareware, meaning that you can test the program free and check
   if it is useful for you.  You have to register if it is useful for you
   (i.e. you pay a small registration fee), then you'll receive the full
   version of QPV/386, along with a so-called registration file (if you ever
   get a newer shareware version, you'll atomatically have the registered
   version of it).

   As you can seen, shareware is pretty much like commercial software
   you can buy in a shop, but you can test it before buying it.
   If you continue using QPV/386 after a trial period (30 days maximum), you
   have to register.  If you don't register, your copy of QPV/386 becomes an
   illegal copy.

   If you think QPV/386 is worth using, then it's certainly worth
   registering.  And QPV/386 is really unexpensive.
   A single registration is valid for all future versions, since registered
   users receive a registration file.  If they ever get a new shareware
   version (e.g. by modem, through a computer network like Fido or
   CompuServe, or from a CD-ROM), it will automatically become the registered
   version again because of the registration file.  Thus updating QPV/386
   saves you and me time and money!

   When you register, you'll get:
    - printed installation instructions
    - a disk containing the current shareware version
    - your personal registration file
    - an easy-to-use install program which installs both QPV/386 and your
         registration file on your hard disk
    - if you like, some more software that I have written
    - some more sample images (if there's space left on the disk)

   You should register NOW.  QPV/386's registration fee will rise sooner or
   later (currently it's really inexpensive) due to inflation.


What to do if you don't want to register
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   In this case you have to delete QPV/386 (including all files belonging to
   it) after the trial period (30 days max) and discontinue using it.
   If a newer version of QPV/386 is released which may fulfil your needs,
   you can test it again, of course.


What to do if you want to register
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1. Please complete and print the registration form (file REGISTER.FRM).

       You can do that by typing the following command at the DOS prompt,
       provided that your printer is attached to the first parallel port
       and ready to print:
          COPY REGISTER.FRM PRN
       The form fits nicely on a single sheet of paper.

       Please write clear and legible if you print the form first and then
       complete it manually.  If you don't have a printer, please write the
       most important items on a piece of paper:
        - your current version of QPV/386
        - your name and complete address (use your REAL name, no alias)
        - if existing: your electronic mail address
        - how you're going to pay the registration fee (see below)
        - your signature
        - if you want: comments, questions etc.

       For a private registration you must use the name of a real person.
       Both private and commercial license are valid for a single person
       or a single PC respectively.  Please ask for prices of multiple
       licences (group licences).

       Please send the form by mail (not email) to one of the following
       addresses:

          Oliver Fromme                              Oliver Fromme
          Leibnizstr. 18-61            or            Klingestr. 2
          38678 Clausthal                            38640 Goslar
          Germany                                    Germany

       Mail sent to the first address (Clausthal) can be processed faster,
       but that address is only valid until 30-September-1996.  If in doubt
       please use the second address (Goslar).

       Sometimes the processing of registrations can be delayed somewhat
       (e.g. vacations, illness, examinations etc.).  I apologize for any
       inconveniences if this happens.

    2. Pay the registration fee (see next question).
       If you pay cash or by cheque, please make sure that it is not
       visible through the envelope.


How to pay the registration fee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There are several possibilities:
    - DM (Deutsche Mark) cash.
    - US Dollar cash.  (Important:  a money order is not cash!)
    - Other currencies:  Please refer to the file PRICES.DOC.
      If you want to pay with a currency that is not covered by that file,
      do the following:  Convert the DM amount (including cheque surcharge
      if you pay by cheque or money order, see below) to your own currency
      using the most current (today's) exchange rate, then add 5%.
    - A Eurocheque.  The amount must be in DM.  No extra surcharge required.
    - Foreign cheque or money order (+ 10 $US or 15 DM).  These kind of
      cheques involve high costs for me, therefore you have to add another
      10 $US or 15 DM surcharge if you pay this way.  Use this way if you
      don't want to send cash through the mail (although you could send it
      as "registered mail" or "recorded delivery") and you can't pay by
      Eurocheque.

   It is not possible to pay by C.O.D. (cash on delivery) or by credit card.
   I don't accept International Money Transfer anymore, because it is rather
   slow (depending on the country), and it involves high costs for me (18 DM,
   that's about 12 $US).


How to get the JPEG Unit / the source code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   You can get the JPEG Unit and their source code using the file
   REGISTER.FRM.  Ordering the unit does not automatically include
   a QPV/386 registration.  If you want both (to order the unit and to
   register QPV/386), you have to pay for both.

   The JPEG Unit is intended to be used by Pascal programmers, you don't
   need to have experiences with Assembly programming.  You must have
   Borland/Turbo Pascal 7.0.  You don't need to have an Assembler, except
   if you want to modify the assembly source.

   There are three versions of the Unit (for different prices):
    - Version A:  This is for private use only.
    - Version B:  (Not available anymore, please order "C" instead.)
    - Version C:  For commercial applications.  It may be used for ONE
                  commercial software.
                  If you want to use it for several different programs,
                  you must buy a licence for each of them.  Please mention
                  the name of the software in the form.
                  You may buy 'Version A' first to see if it fits your needs.
    - Version D:  For an unlimited number of commercial applications.
                  (Please contact me for pricing information.)

   The Unit itself and its source code must not be given to someone else
   (regardless of the version).  It can not be re-sold.

   The JPEG Unit package includes:
    - the Unit (*.TPU) for decoding JPEG files (see QPV.DOC for a more
      detailed description of its capabilities)
    - its source (*.PAS)
    - the object file (*.OBJ) of the assembly part
    - its source (*.ASM)
    - A documentation file, explaining how to use the unit within your own
      Pascal programs
    - A help file (*.TPH) which can be loaded into the Pascal IDE, it
      consists of almost the whole documentation.

   A DLL library which can be used for Windows and protected mode
   applications is under development and will be available soon.
   I'm also working on a Delphi VLC component.
