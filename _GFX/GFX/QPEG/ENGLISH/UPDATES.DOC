               How to get updates and new versions of QPV/386
              ================================================


This documentation file describes how to get updates and new versions of
QPV/386.  This applies to both unregistered and registered users:
 - Unregistered users can get updates of the unregistered shareware version.
 - Registered users got a so-called personal registration file along with
   their registration disk.  If you install a new shareware version (in the
   same directory as your registered version), your registration file will
   NOT be overwritten, thus you'll automatically have the registered version
   again.

There's a mailing list which you can subscribe to.  All recipients of the
list will automatically be notified by email whenever a new version of
QPV/386 is released.  To subscribe to the list, send an email with the
subject "subscribe QPV/386" to my email address (fromme@rz.tu-clausthal.de).


Internet FTP
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   GERMANY/EUROPE:

      ftp.tu-clausthal.de (139.174.2.10) /pub/msdos/graphics/view

      This is the primary distribution site.  New versions will be available
      here first.  This site only has a small 64Kbit line, so please don't
      connect during business hours if possible (local time CET/DLS).
      This site also offers an email service (see below).

   U.S.A./WORLD:

      ftp.wustl.edu   /pub/msdos_uploads/graphics

      The above sites will carry new QPV/386 versions one or two days after
      release.  If you can't connect to "ftp.wustl.edu" (if that host is
      unknown to your site), try "wuarchive.wustl.edu" instead.  I also
      upload it to "uniwa.uwa.edu.au" (Australia) where it will be available
      in /pub/povray/viewer, but I'm not sure how long that service will be
      available.

      ftp.best.com   /pub/bryanw/qpeg

      This is the graphics archive of Bryan Woodworth.  You should always be
      able to find the latest version of QPV/386 there.  Thanks Bryan!


World Wide Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   http://www.rz.tu-clausthal.de/~inof/q.html

      This WWW page contains pointers to several places where you can get
      QPV/386 (usually FTP references).  You also find useful information
      about QPV/386 here:  latest news, known bugs (including fixes or work-
      arounds) and other interesting things.


Usenet News
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Current versions of QPV/386 are posted regularly to the Usenet newsgroup
   "alt.binaries.pictures.utilities".  You can get it from there through any
   of its associated nets.


Email Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   mail-server@ftp.tu-clausthal.de

   You can get QPV/386 from the primary FTP server even if you don't have
   FTP or Internet access.  However, you must be able to send and receive
   email.  The FTP site at Clausthal maintains a so-called automatic mail
   server which can send files from the server to anybody by email.
   The server's email address is "mail-server@ftp.tu-clausthal.de".
   Note that you won't reach a real person by mailing to that address, but
   a program which reacts based on commands embedded in the email.
   For more information send a mail containing the single word "HELP" to the
   mail server.

Snail Mail
~~~~~~~~~~

   Just send me 5 DM (10 DM outside Europe) or 5 $US, and I will send you
   the current version of QPV/386.  Germans only:  You can also send me a
   disk and a selfaddressed and stamped envelope (2 DM for DIN-B6/DL, or
   3 DM for DIN-B5 or larger).

   Please do not send me non-German stamps.  I can not use them, and I can
   not exchange them.  Especially you French guys:  Do not send me French
   stamps!  I have a pretty large collection of French stamps, and they are
   absolutely useless for me.
