Purpose of VESA2CFG:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VESA2CFG checks the existence of an VBE (VESA BIOS Extension), either built
into the VGA BIOS ROM, or installed as a TSR driver.  If an VBE is detected,
an appropriate CFG file for QPV/386 is created.

The name of the CFG file is QPV.CFG by default, but a different name may
be specified on the command line.

For further information about which VESA modes are supported by your graphics
card, use the VESATEST utility (see VESATEST.DOC for details).
