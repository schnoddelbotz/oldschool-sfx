     SUMMARY FEATURES ----------------------------------------- 12/06/90-pre

     26HDCOM.COM, HC for short, requires an IBM PC, XT, AT, AT-386, or other
     close compatible and DOS 2 or above. It's a TSR program that monitors
     the hard drives (D: also on ATs only) by reporting the drive, cylinder,
     head, sector, and status of the disk controller. HC can also monitor
     the serial ports/modem and will report DTR,RTS,CTS,DSR,RI,DCD and also
     bps and communication protocol (parity, data & stop bits).

     What makes HC even more useful is that it displays the status line on
     the 26th line of IBM compatible video systems, including the CGA, EGA
     and VGA color systems. For IBM compatible monochrome systems, the status
     line is displayed on line 1. This status line can be momentarily disabled
     by having Scroll Lock on, or by pressing the ALT key down.

     STATUS LINE ---------------------------------------------------------

C:1023 Hd:15 Sc:63  OK                         DTR RTS CTS DSR RI  DCD 38400 N81

     is what the status line looks like full-blown.  The hard drive letter
     is followed by the current cylinder, head, sector, error message, and
     then the serial port status.  On color systems this is black with a green
     background.  On monochrome systems it's in reverse video.

     Possible disk errors are (including floppy):

                 0  OK
                 1  BAD COMMAND
                 2  ADDRESS MARK NOT FOUND

     A disk error will be retained on the status line for 2 seconds
     provided that no new error occurs within that time.

     The COM section monitors:

                RTS Ready to send
                CTS Clear to send        &   bps rate

     USAGE ---------------------------------------------------------------

     HC occupies about 2500 bytes of system RAM with a standard DOS
     environment when resident and is controlled by command line options.

      HC       * install TSR to monitor status
      HC /U    * remove from memory
      HC /S    * sleep mode
      HC /R    * restore status line and awaken if in sleep mode
      HC /Cn   * monitor COM port (n=1-4  0=off)
      HC /Mn   * select controller BIOS data interpret mode (n=1-4)
      HC /H    * help

     At the COMMAND prompt, enter HC.  This installs the TSR portion.

     There are currently three different interpretation modes supported for
     the harddisk BIOS data area.  HC will start up in mode 1 (generally
     XT controllers).  If you have an AT use mode 3 (drive 0=C:) or 4
     (drive 1=D:). If this doesn't work with your AT, try mode 2 (non-BIOS
     controller card).  To change the mode that HC starts up in, use a
     disk editor (Norton's, PC Tools, etc.) and change the byte at 113
     decimal (71 hex) from '1' to the mode you want (1 to 4).  This is
     the character '1' to '4', not ASCII 01 to 04.  If you don't want
     to change it permanently you can still change it with the command
     line option /M2, /M3, /M4.

     BIOS supports 4 COM ports.  To select the port to monitor, use HC/Cn
     where n equals 0 - 4.  0 will turn off any current COM monitoring.

     HC can be removed from memory (HC/U).  This should only be
     done when at DOS's top level, not from a shell, and really only
     when it is the last current TSR installed.  I say 'really' because
     HC checks to make sure that the interrupt it uses still points to
     itself, i.e., no other TSR is using it.  You can safely try HC/U at
     anytime (at top level); HC will only remove itself if safe to do so.
     A better way to 'disconnect' HC is to use the sleep mode /S.

     Sleep mode (HC/S) is performed by unchaining HC from the user timer-tick
     interrupt that it uses (1Ch) and replacing the interrupt vector to the
     one active when HC was installed.  This means that HC can be 'turned off'
     even after shelling to DOS from another program.  Very useful.  And of
     course, HC can be restored to its active state with /R.

     The restore function (HC/R) awakens the dormant HC and also resets the
     display to 26 lines on color systems, since any video mode change
     (e.g., MODE co80) will reprogram the system to its default mode.  Note
     that EGA or VGA systems must be in standard mode, i.e., 25 lines,
     not 43 or 50, to either install or restore.  The VGA should also be
     connected to a VGA monitor (720x400 is the std text mode of the VGA).
     If you are in a non-compatible mode, HC will not install or restore
     itself but just exit with an error message.

     It sure is nice to know what your harddisk and modem are up to.
     The MASM assembly source is included for your computing pleasure.
