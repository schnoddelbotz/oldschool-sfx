	This library was distributed absolutely FREE from Jim Woolly and
	Mike Welch at The Shipyard.  QuickSHARE is a free QuickBASIC
	information/library exchange.  You can receive the latest Quick-
	BASIC 4.00+ libraries, source code, and general information from
	The Shipyard or from Mike Welch via USPS.  Get a catalog today!

	The Shipyard (Garland, Texas):  (214)-686-1962 is a PC-Pursuitable
	BBS.  If you're calling long distance, you can have immediate Up-
	load/Down-load access (unlike most systems that require you to
	register and wait).  To access the online QuickSHARE files area:

			First/Last Name:  Quick Basic
			User Password:    QuickSHARE

	You will be given a limited amount of time (15 minutes) to down-
	load whatever QuickBASIC libraries and text files you want.  If
	you would like more time on that call, you'll need to upload.
	Uploads give a 1-to-10 time ratio.  Thus, if your upload takes
	5 minutes, you'll get another 50 (until 1 hour is reached). 
	Please limit your calls to one hour per day, to give others time
	on the system.  Finally, if you're local to the Dallas/Garland/
	Plano area, you'll have to go through the normal registration
	process.  This is based on the honor system and the pleasure of
	free information exchange!!!

	For a recent catalog of libraries, download the file named
	QSCAT.EXE (binary, self-extract) or QSHARE.CAT (ASCII).  

	QuickSHARE is also available via USPS (mail).  If you would		
	like to receive a catalog, send a SASD (Self-Addressed-Stamped
	Diskmailer & a PC compatible floppy) or $1.50 to:

				QuickSHARE
				Michael Welch
				PO BOX 401011
				Dallas, TX  75240

	Catalogs and appropriate instructions will be sent to you as
	soon as possible.  This is a FREE service!!!
