Boot-B:  Boot the B: Drive

Do you have tons of games on 5.25" diskettes that can only run by
booting them, but you can't run them because your A: drive is a 3.5"
drive?  Now you can.  By using Boot-B: you can start most of those
diskettes from the B: drive.  Boot-B: is a program that creates a new
boot sector for a disk in drive A: which when booted will pass the
boot process over to the B: drive.

It is not a TSR (obviously), nor does it in any way alter the format of
the diskette.  It simply replaces the non-functional boot sector of
the floppy with one that redirects the boot process.  All DOS disk
parameters are left unaltered.  Since Boot-B: does all of its changes
in the boot sector, the BOOT_B program does not need to be present on
the floppy disk.

In many cases, using BOOT_B without any parameters will work fine.  Some
hardware configurations may require one of the switches to help identify
the disk and drive combination.

Using Boot-B:

  BOOT_B  [options]

  options are:

           T1  -   Drive B: is a 360K floppy in a 360K drive

           T2  -   Drive B: is a 360K floppy in a 1.2M drive

           T3  -   Drive B: is a 1.2M floppy in a 1.2M drive

           T4  -   Drive B: is a 720K floopy in a 720K drive

       REBOOT  -   Restart system skipping memory tests

     WARMBOOT  -   Restart system skipping memory tests (same as reboot)

     COLDBOOT  -   Restart system including memory tests


  Place a formatted diskette in drive A: and type the command:

     BOOT_B  [option1 option2]

  When Boot-B: is run, it will check the disk in Drive A: and determine
  whether it currently has a system on it.  If it does have a system
  on it, you will be asked if you want to continue with the process.
  If you choose to continue, Boot-B: will alter the disk in drive A: so
  that whenever the computer is started with that disk in drive A:,
  the B: drive will be used to start the computer.  If you use Boot-B:
  on a diskette with a system, it will remove the system files from
  the diskette since they are no longer needed.

  If the disk in drive A: does not contain a system but Boot-B:
  determines it was not formatted under DOS (possibly a game disk),
  you will be given a warning that it was not formatted under DOS and
  asked if you want to continue.  If you continue, the disk in Drive
  A: will be altered to Boot the B: drive.

  If the disk was formatted under DOS and there is no system on it,
  Boot-B: will alter the disk in Drive A: without any warnings or
  prompts.

  Boot-B: does all of its changes in the boot record of the disk in
  drive A:.  Under no circumstances will it write to your fixed disk.

  Examples:

      BOOT_B T2 Warmboot     - will alter the disk in drive A: so that
                               it will boot a 360k diskette in a 1.2M
                               B: drive.  After the boot sector is fixed
                               on the A: disk the computer will be
                               warm started.

      BOOT_B T3 Coldboot     - will alter the disk in drive A: so that
                               it will boot a 1.2M diskette in a 1.2M
                               B: drive.  After the boot sector is fixed
                               on the A: disk the computer will be
                               cold started.

      BOOT_B                 - will alter the disk in drive A: so that
                               it will boot the diskette in Drive B:
                               using the ROM BIOS default settings for
                               the drive.


You may get an error message telling you to try another Boot-B:
configuration.  This is caused by incorrect information for the disk
and drive.  Simply re-run Boot-B: using the correct option for the
disk and drive (T1, T2, T3, or T4).

Items to consider:

   1.  If your B: drive needs to a device driver such as DRIVER.SYS
       to make it work, Boot-B: most likely won't work since the
       device drivers cannot be loaded before the boot process
       starts.  But it doesn't hurt to try.

   2.  If your games were written to run on a system with Color Graphics
       Adapter and they look funny on your VGA, try setting your adapter
       to CGA and reboot the computer.  For example: If you have a
       Paradise VGA card and you need to boot in CGA mode, create your
       boot disk, then issue the command VGAPLUS CGA REBOOT.  This
       will reboot your system in CGA mode.

   3.  Starting DOS from the B: drive is not recommended.  DOS will overlay
       some of the drive controlling logic placed in top of conventional
       memory at boot time.
