                               USING WHATFAX
                               =============

WhatFax is a simple command line utility. Invoke Whatfax from the DOS
prompt by typing WHATFAX.  You may specify a number of options when invok-
ing WhatFax:

     /B   -    To Bypass the CAS driver test.


     /Cx  -    To specify the COM port used by your Fax Modem.
               (x = 1..4 for COM1 through COM4)

     WhatFax supports COM1 through COM4. WhatFax obtains the COM port
     address from the BIOS data area (Segment 40h), thus in order for
     WhatFax to recognize your COM port, the BIOS must be aware of the COM
     ports in your system.

     /Ix  -    Specify alternative IRQ number.

     By default WhatFax will use the following COM port to IRQ number mapping:

          COM1 - IRQ4, COM2 - IRQ3, COM3 - IRQ4, COM4 - IRQ3.

     This works for most installations. If your COM port does not use the
     default IRQ number, you may override the default numbers. For example:
     /I5  would cause IRQ5 to be used.

     /H   -    display a help screen.


Some examples:

     WHATFAX /C1         -    Causes WhatFax to check the modem on COM1.

     WHATFAX /C2 /B      -    Causes WhatFax to check the modem on COM2 but
                              the CAS driver test is not performed.

     WHATFAX /C3 /I3     -    Causes WhatFax to check the modem on COM3
                              using IRQ 3.
