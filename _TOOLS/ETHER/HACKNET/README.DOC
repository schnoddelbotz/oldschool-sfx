Introduction
------------
This program is designed to work with most NetBIOS compatible networks.
The program NETSPY allows you call another networked PC host and remotly
monitor/control applications running on the host machine. Currently NETSPY
does not provide support for graphics applications. However, most text mode
applications are very responsive running remotly under NETSPY.

If you like NETSPY and decide to use it on a regular basis, we request a $30
shareware registration fee. Please send contributions to the above address
to register  your copy.

Free RCP Bonus!!!
-----------------
As an extra bonus we are including RCP/RCPS remote file copy utilities.
These programs allow copying files files back and forth over the network
without a file server. These utilities can be used with NETSPY to copy 
files to and from remote host machines without a file server. See the
notes at the end of the document describe the usage of RCP.

Installing the NETSPYD Driver on Host Machines
----------------------------------------------
In order to use NETSPY you must copy one of the host drivers on each machine
you intend to spy on in the network. The NETSPY host driver is supplied in
two forms:

	NETSPYD.EXE a memory resident TSR device driver.
	NETSPYD.SYS a loadable CONFIG.SYS device driver.

Typically the TSR form is required for most NetBIOS networks. You must make
sure that NetBIOS is loaded before loading NETSPYD.EXE or NETSPYD.SYS! Most
networks will require the TSR version NETSPYD.EXE (i.e. Lantastic, etc...)
because the NetBIOS is implemented as a TSR itself. However, if your system's
NetBIOS is a device driver or ROM resident you may use NETSPYD.SYS if you
wish.

The host driver listens in the background for calls from any NETSPY client
and creates a remote session when called. YOU MUST ASSIGN A UNIQUE NETWORK
HOST NAME FOR EACH HOST! This name may contain up to 15 characters and is 
the name supplied to NETSPY.EXE when calling a particular node to spy on.
Both NETSPY host device drivers accept the following command line syntax:

	/N:{name}	Required host name (15 chars max, case insensitive)
	/L		No logo flag; prevents load logo from displaying
	/E		No eyes flag; prevents eyes from appearing on host
	/Q		Quiet mode; same as /L and /E together

  Remote Host Examples:

	C:>NETSPYD /N:STEVE		(we can spy on STEVE now!!!)
  or...
	C:>NETSPYD /N:STEVE /Q		(put in the boss's AUTOEXEC.BAT!!!)


Installing NETSPY on Administrator Machines
-------------------------------------------
After your have installed the host driver on the various network machines
you plan to spy on, copy the file NETSPY.EXE to your system administrators
disk in any convenient location. You may also place NETSPY on host machines
or any other machine you want to give spy capability on.

If you plan to have several people spying on various nodes, you must set
the environment variable NETSPY to a unique spy client name. Like the HOST
node name, this name should be unique for all nodes. This is the name of
the spy person who is watching a host. If the name already exists, others
will not be able to spy using the same name until the spy session for that
name has closed. By default the spy name is set to "NETSPY" if not specified
by the environment variable NETSPY. To set the spy name enter the following
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT or at the DOS prompt type:

	SET NETSPY=ADMIN-SPY1

For initial installation you don't have worry about this. You just may have
only one spy active at time if not set. Now we are ready to spy on someone.
To create a spy session from the administrators machine, type the following
at the command line:

	C:>NETSPY STEVE

After a few seconds, the screen should clear and appear just as is does
on the host machine. At this point any keys you type will be directed to 
the host machine (be carefull on other peoples machines - they may be 
working!). If the /E or /Q option was not specified on the host, you will
see a pair of eyes in the upper right hand corner of your screen indicating
someone is spying. The exit NETSPY press LEFT-SHIFT plus ESC to exit back
to your local machine.

If no name is supplied to NETSPY you will be prompted for the remote host
name. If the name does not exists the call will abort and an error message
will be displayed. The only restrictions to spying are as follows:

	1) You can't spy on yourself (mirror spying). In the
	   above examples STEVE should not type NETSPY STEVE on
	   his machine or a mirror condition will exist. 

	2) Don't spy back on someone you know is spying on you. This
	   will cause mirror spying also. You may spy on someone who
	   is already spying on another person (chain spying).

	3) Don't spy on someone running a graphics or multi-tasking type
	   of program on their machine.


Miscellaneous Notes
-------------------
* Be careful when spying on other machines. You may come in at any time on 
  someone elses machine. Depending on the application they are running there
  is always the possibilty of crashing a machine. Most text programs should
  work with NETSPY.

* You may want to only allow one spy at a time by not setting the NETSPY
  environment variable to avoid "chain" and "mirror" spying conditions and
  reduce network traffic. Too many spies will bog the network down.


Using RCP Utilities
-------------------
The RCP programs are similar to the UNIX rcp programs. Under DOS, the host
node must execute the RCP server RCPS to listen for calling clients. Set the
environment variable RCPHOST to create a unique 15 character node name for 
each active RCPS host. You may also specify the host name from the command
line as follows:

	C> rcps bobs-at

RCP client may copy files to and from any RCPS host using the following
syntax:

	RCP [host:source] [host:destination]

The syntax is similar to the DOS copy command except RCP requires a source
and destination name. The follow commands illustrate some RCP usage examples:

EXAMPLE 1: Copy all C files from BOBS-XT on C:\MSC\PROJECST to local drive

	C> rcp bobs-xt:c:\msc\projects\*.c

EXAMPLE 1: Copy all files from BOBS-XT current dir to local drive \TMP

	C> rcp bobs-xt:*.* \tmp

Unlike the UNIX RCP, this program does not allow copying between remote
machines. You may only copy to and from a remote host to your local machine.
