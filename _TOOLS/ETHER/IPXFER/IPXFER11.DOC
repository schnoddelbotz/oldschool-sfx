IPXFER v1.10
============

IPXFER is a set of utilities for sending files accross an IPX network. This
eliminates the headache of juggling floppies when you are exchanging, say
for instance PWADs.

Well, here is the v1.10 release.  Thanks to a few individuals that have
bothered to reply to my request for comments, I have decided to continue
work on this program.

This program fixes a small bug in v1.00 that would cause a really weird
result if you told it to send files that did not exist.  I have also
once again tweaked the packet sequencing method.  I have yet to have a
transfer lock with v1.10  (I have beta tested it by sending better than
500Mb of data back and forth... I guess its pretty well bug free now.)

DISCLAIMER
==========

The author of this program accepts NO resposibility for any damage whether
it be Software, Hardware, or Mental from the use of this program.

============
DISTRUBUTION
============

Everyone and anyone that can use a copy of this program is more than welcome
to it!  Just please include this text file!

===========
Limitations
===========

   You can only receive files on one computer at a time.  I'm working on this,
   but its tougher than it sounds.  It's hard enough to try to make sure the
   file gets there intact when IPX does NO packet checking itself.

   You MUST be in the directory of the files that you wish to send.  (Don't
   enter something like the following:  SENDNET C:\DOOM\WADS\*.WAD)

   The speed of your hard drive!

This program can only transfer data as fast as your computer can process
it and write it to your hard drive.  The physical limit at which this program
is capable of transmitting data is around 900,000cps!!! (Memory to Memory
transfer and no CRC checking)

The following are actual transfer speeds that I have experienced when sending
a file of about 1Mb in size between different computers:

                            
      386dx/40              386sx/40Mhz
      11ms IDE HDD      =>  28ms IDE HDD          = 50,000 cps
      2Mb Disk Cache        384kb Disk Cache

      386sx/40              386dx/40Mhz
      28ms IDE HDD      =>  11ms IDE HDD          = 70,000 cps
      384kb Disk Cache      2Mb Disk Cache

      386dx/40              486sx/33Mhz
      11ms IDE HDD      =>  11ms IDE HDD          = 85,000 cps
      2Mb Disk Cache        1Mb Disk Cache

      386dx/40              486dx/50Mhz
      11ms IDE HDD      =>  10ms IDE HDD          = 95,000 cps
      2Mb Disk Cache        1Mb Disk Cache

      486sx/33              486dx/50Mhz
      11ms IDE HDD      =>  10ms IDE HDD          = 110,000 cps
      1Mb Disk Cache        1Mb Disk Cache

I'm dying to try it between a couple of 486's that have fast SCSI hard drives!

Not bad when you compare it to the absolute maximum of 11,000cps when sending
between 2 computers at 115,200baud (IF, and ONLY IF they both have 16550
UARTS)!

=======================
How to use this program
=======================

   On the sendning computer enter

      SENDNET filename.ext  (This CAN include wildcards)

   On the receiving computer enter

      RECNET

 Thats all there is to it!

 BTW, you have to have LAN cards and your IPX drivers loaded first (DUH!) :)

IF you have a transfer crash and have to CTRL-BREAK your way out of it, enter
the following command 

      CLOSES

This closes the sockets used by IPXFER so that you can initialize another
transfer.

                              Josh

PS- If you have a transfer lockup that is not the fault of you IPX drivers, or
the lack of good cables/terminators... PLEASE let me know.  I have not had
any lockups whatsoever with v1.10  but, the hardest bugs to kill are ones
that don't show up on your computer!

If you are interested in setting up an IPX based network for playing DOOM,
or anything else that uses it (Windows for Workgroupd, Novell, etc),  I am
currently selling IPX based cards for my cost (wholesale) plus shipping.

I am selling a variety of cards and their accessories starting at around $40.

-or- if you are just having trouble using one of my programs, would like to
register one (not required, but I will be sure to send you lots of other
great utilities for DOOM), or would like some tech support setting up an IPX
based network for DOOM, feel free to mail or call me at the below address/
