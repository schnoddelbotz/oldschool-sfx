          Manual for using NetCB

==============================================================================

-- Using NetCB

NetCB uses IPX so if you manage to get Novell up and running without IPX (I
still can't figure out how you do that), you can't chat.

NetCB uses IPX because NetCB works 'connection-less'. No virtual circuit is
build between the chatters, anybody can come into the chat and leave it as
he/she likes without extra communication between the chatters.

To join a running chat on a network, simply fire up NetCB, think of a funny
name for yourself and on you go.

To get the other users an idea of who's chatting along, messages are send in
the chat when you join the chat, leave it or change your nickname or change
channels.

When you join in the chat, the message is :

<Nickname> / <server>\<loginname> [n] is joining in with the chat.

So if your logged in as GUEST on a server named FILEBASE on logical connection
3 and you want to chat using the nickname Mr. Bean, a line is send in the chat
looking like :

Mr. Bean / FILEBASE\GUEST [3] is joining in with the chat.

Because NetCB only uses IPX, it's not needed to be logged in. So you might also
get something like :

Mr. Bean / FILEBASE\<not logged in> [3] is joining in with the chat.

Or, even not being attached to any server (only IPX loaded), it looks like :

Mr. Bean / <not attaced>\-- [3] is joining in with the chat.

When chatting, the bottom of the screen looks like :

|                                                                             |
+- Mr. Bean on Channel 00 [Public Access] ------------------------------------+
| _                                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

At this line you get a flashing cursor. Type the line you want to sent. When
you press [Enter], the line is sent to everyone on the network (broadcast).

Everyone running NetCB sees it appear on his/her screen, if he/she is 'tuned'
into the same channel.

Channels are implemented just like C.B. channels. You can select a channel
using the up/down cursor keys or Alt-C to select channel 0. The current channel
and it's defined name are indicated in the line above the entry-line. Names
are defined in the configuration file. There are 64 possible channels numbered
from 0 to 63.

The top half of the screen looks like :

          --- 12:11 -- Traffic : 0   v --+
                                         |

The traffic value is the number of chat packets recieved in all channels in the
last minute. This value is updated every second.
Just right to the traffic indicator is an 'activity' indicator. Every time a
packet is recieved for NetCB (all packets are checked for a 'signature' which
consists of 'KH' and a 0x01) the activity indicator will turn right one step.

Using F1 you get a window which shows the available keys. They are :

Arrow keys to select channels (0..19)
Alt-C to select channel 0
Alt-W to get the userlist (private chat not implemented yet...:-(
Alt-N to select a new nickname (the other users of the chat will get a warning
      message..)
Alt-T to get a scaled graph on the packets recieved in the last minute in every
      channel. So if you get the strange idea 'where is everybody ?', you can
      look in this window. This window can be scrolled to view all channels, it
      starts around your own channel.
Alt-I information on NetCB. It shows the short info, the credits for this
      program and some info on you and the total number of packets recieved
      since starting.

When you press Alt-W, you get a window and a 'Building list...' line. To make
sure every answer to the "who's there ?" packet is recieved, NetCB waits some
time. After that you get a complete list of the users. The order in which
they are shown is kinda random and will change every time you access this
window. This is due to the fact that NetCB waits a short random time after
it recieves a "who's there ?" packet to avoid a great number of network
collisions.

You can browse through the list and press [Enter] to get more info on the
selected user.

The time spend waiting for all replies to return is calculated as follows :

3 * (longest single route in the network) + 5 ticks. Each tick is 1/18 of a
second.

This should be sufficient in most cases.

-- Nickname protection

NetCB now has nickname protection. When a nickname is entered, NetCB will
transmit this fact to all stations. When someone else has the same nickname,
it will reply. This reply will 'lock' the chat until a new nickname is entered.

-- Command line options

By populair demand ;-)

Start NetCB like :

NetCB [/c=<channel>] [/n=<nickname>] [/s]

So to start on channel 12 with nickname "Big Boy", enter :

NetCB /c=12 /n="Big Boy"

When there are no spaces in the name, it's also allowed to type :

NetCB /c=12 /n=Speedy

/s means 'Stealthmode'. In this mode your loginname and servername will be
hidden from the chat. I've been in situations where this is quite handy...

-- Configuration

When a configuration file NetCB.Ctl is found in the current directory, it will
be used. The following items can be defined in this configuration file :

LogName

- When this item is enabled, the login name will be used as nickname, and you
will not be asked for it when starting.

FullName

- When this item is enabled, the full name will be used as nickname.

ChanName <channel> <name>

- With this item you can give channels names. Channel 0 is hardcoded to be
'Public Access'. Other channels can be named like :

ChanName  1 Chat lovers
ChanName  2 Blind Dates
ChanName 13 TeleShopping

StealtMode

- This activates 'Stealthmode' in which loginname and servername will be hidden
from the chat.

-- Notes for system managers

These are in the file SYSMANAG.

-- Multiple Netware networks

Well, this is the part you all have been waiting for (I've been saving the
fanmail, and it's the most Frequently Asked Question on NetCB!).

I've been digging around Netware a lot to find the optimum way to find the
'All Reachable Networks' list. At first I looked into the possibilities of
the diagnostics calls, but after a while I found out that they can be
disabled, which would lead to a not-allways-running NetCB.
After that I kept on looking around and got a little lucky since Novell
decided to release the complete specifications of RIP (Routing Information
Protocol). I don't know if my asking around has done something to do with
the release, but you never know this sort of thing...

This means you can chat 'campus-wide' or 'WAN-wide'. You'll chat with people
who can be in totally different buildings, or even kilometres away, depending
on the network topology.

Anyone interested in an example 'Get network list using RIP' source can mail
me. It took me so long to gather this information and I've got a whole pack
of 'me too' messages, so I think there's interest for this information.

-- Netware Lite

NetCB also works with Netware Lite. The previous version had to work with it
also but wasn't tested (and a test showed that it didn't work). This version
can handle Netware Lite. You'll allways show up as 'not logged in' though.
NetCB will issue a warning that there where no routers found. This is correct.

-- Credits

Thanks go to numerous people. Of course thanks goes to the system managers at
my school who couldn't figure out what was going on on the network for about
four weeks. Now they want to stop me from using it at school. Wait and see.

Thanks also goes to the ones who tested it at my school. Famous names like
'Sammy Suitcase', 'Slim', 'Me again', 'Elmer Fudd', 'Scatterbrain' and others
helped me to test NetCB throroughly.

Thanks to A.R.Goodman <A.R.Goodkin@ais.salford.ac.uk> who gave me an example
source for getting the list of known network numbers.

Thanks goes to Charles G. Rose for writing an excellent book about programming
Netware : 'Programmers Guide to Netware'.

I'd also like to thank the people at Salford University in England for
betatesting NetCB. The've been great in testing this new version.

-- What's with the Un-Greetings ?

You'll probably wonder who the people are that are 'Un-Greeted'. Well, those
are people who tried to forbid NetCB on the network that they where supposed
to manage. I can't find any valid reason for why someone should forbid the
usage of NetCB or it should be that that particular someone didn't like the
idea of some student hanging around 'their' network and being able to program
it better then they will ever be able to.

Please make sure I can get your country/state from your (E-)mail. I have a map
showing all NetCB usage locations in the world and I'd like to keep it up to
date.

-- Donations

So you'd like to donate an amount of money to me since you think this is a
great thing ?
Well, getting money from A to B when there are country borders in between
costs more then the money's worth (unless you're making a big donation...).

So I want to propose this : I really like coffee mugs. You know, what you
drink your first coffee from in the morning. So, if you can get me a really
nice coffee mug (with a company or university logo) for me, I'm also very
pleased. Send'em to the above address (don't forget to pack them thoroughly).
You will have my gratitude eternally.
