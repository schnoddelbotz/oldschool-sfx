	    Help on Commands in the CONFIGURE menu

 You can specify any combination of the LEFT SHIFT, RIGHT SHIFT,
 CTRL and ALT keys for use as 'hotkeys'.  These keys (shown by
 ticks in the menu) access the popup menu when watching,
 controlling, sharing or showing.  Choose a combination which does
 not conflict with any TSR's running on the control or slave.

 BIOS KEYBOARD	  should be used for 'protected mode' programs such
		  as Lotus 123 release 3.  Use the LOW LEVEL
		  KEYBOARD for Windows.
 KEYBOARD LAYOUT  caters for different control keyboard layouts.
 SELECT MODEM	  selects from the modems listed in CONTROL.MDM.

	     Help on Commands in the COMMUNICATIONS Menu

 FILE TRANSFER	 copies files to or from the current slave.
 DIAL		 dials a remote LAN; this requires NetSupport
		 Remote NetBIOS (NBREMOTE) or NetSupport Remote IPX
		 (IPREMOTE) to be loaded before CONTROL is run.
 HANGUP 	 hangs up the phone if you are connected to a
		 remote LAN.  At this point, you can elect to use
		 the local LAN, if any.
 DIAL DIRECTORY  Views/edits the dialling directory.

	     Help on Finding Slaves on the Network

 To find all slaves, leave the name blank and press ENTER.

 If there are a lot of slaves on your network, enter the first
 few letters of the slave name(s) that you want to find
 (Control will list a maximum of 100).

 The listbox then shows all matching slaves visible on the
 network.  Slaves attached via a NetWare serial bridge will not
 appear in this list (use MANUAL CONNECT instead).  The same
 applies if you are working over a phone line using Novell's
 remote IPX.

 Press ESC to continue:
 12
		 Help on CONNECT/DISCONNECT

 The listbox shows slaves visible on the network (CONNECT) or
 slaves currently connected (DISCONNECT).  Slaves attached via
 a NetWare serial bridge will not appear in this list (use
 MANUAL CONNECT instead).  The same applies if you are working
 over a phone line using Novell's remote IPX.

 Highlight the slave required using the arrow keys, then press
 SPACE or ENTER; connected slaves are indicated by a tick (û).
 When finished, press ESC or F10.

 F3 connects to all slaves (up to 12); F4 breaks all connections.

 Press ESC to continue:
 13
		    Help on MANUAL CONNECT

 Type in the name of the slave you wish to connect to.
 Up to 12 connections can be established at any one time
 (this number can be changed with the /S command line parameter).

 When a connection is successful, the number of connections
 displayed in the top right-hand corner of the screen is updated
 and flashes for a few seconds.





 Press ESC to continue:
 14
			Help on PASSWORD

 The bridge or selected slave requires a password before you can
 access it.

 Note that this password is encrypted with the CALCPSW program;
 you must enter the non-encrypted form here.







 Press ESC to continue:
 15

		      Help on SEND MESSAGE

 Enter the message that you wish to send (up to 4 lines) and then
 press F10.

 Depending on the command chosen from the menu, the message will
 be sent to the current slave, or to all slaves connected.

 The message will remain on the slave screen(s) until the user
 acknowledges it, or until another message is sent or CHAT is
 invoked.  During this time, processing on the slave machine(s)
 is suspended.	You can CONTROL a slave to acknowledge the message
 remotely.

 Press ESC to continue:
 17
			Help on CHAT

 This command displays keystrokes as they are typed on both the
 control and slave screens.  While CHAT is active, other processing
 is suspended.

 Crtl+G sends a beep.  This can be useful for attracting the
 attention of the remote party.

		Help on Communications Commands

 These commands are used to establish communication with a
 remote LAN, or to select the local LAN.

    DIAL DIRECTORY   use/edit the dialling directory.
    DIAL MANUALLY    dial a number entered manually.
    SERIAL LINK      direct or pre-dialled serial link.
    LOCAL LAN	     the LAN that this machine is connected to.
    SET BAUD RATE    set baud rate, parity etc.
    SELECT MODEM     specify the type of your modem.
    DOS 	     'shells out' to the MS-DOS command line.
    QUIT PROGRAM     terminates Control.

 Press ESC to continue:
 21
		    Help on Dial Remote Lan

 Enter the phone number to dial.  Spaces and hyphens may be
 inserted for readability if desired.

 To pause between digits (if using a PABX, for instance), insert
 a comma (',') to wait for 4 seconds, or W to wait for a dial tone,
 e.g.:
    0,071 222 1234	or	0 W 071-222-1234

 For pulse dialling, precede the number with a P.
 For tone dialling, precede the number with a T.


 Press ESC to continue:
 22
		    Help on Set Baud Rate

 Select the baud rate which corresponds to your modem.	Many
 modern modems offer auto-baud detection.  In this case, use a
 value greater than or equal to the data rate of the modem itself;
 consult your modem namual for details.

 If you experience unreliable communications, try reducing the
 baud rate.  Some non-PS2 machines will not run reliably above
 9600 baud; most XT class machines are limited to 2400 baud.

 If using a direct serial link, the baudrate of NBBRIDGE or
 IPBRIDGE must be set to the same value as NBREMOTE or IPREMOTE.
