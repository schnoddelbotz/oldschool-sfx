                           Command line mode

                        The command-line options

F-PROT.EXE is usually run without any parameters and will then enter
interactive mode.  It is also possible to run it in command-line mode,
either by specifying a drive, file or directory to scan, or by using the
/COMMAND option.

Syntax for command-line mode:  F-PROT [drive, file or directory] [options]

The available command-line options are

/640
On certain old machines, scanning non-existing memory between 640K and 1M
may cause a system crash.  This switch instructs F-PROT to scan only 640K.

/ALL
Specifies that all files should be searched, not just normal "executable"
files.  This switch should never be used with /ANALYSE, but only if a
virus has already been found, and you are just making sure it is not
hiding in some obscure overlay file.

/ANALYSE
Performs a heuristic analysis after the "Secure" scan.  This approach may
cause false positives, and should be used with care.  See the file
ANALYSE.DOC for further information.

/APPEND
Used with /REPORT. Append the report to an existing file.

/AUTO
May be specified with /DELETE or /DISINF so F-PROT will not request
permission before deleting or disinfecting.  The default if only /DELETE
or /DISINF are given is to ask if the file should be disinfected (or
deleted).

/BOOT (default) /NOBOOT
Scan/Don't scan boot sectors.

/COMMAND
Force command-line mode.

/DELETE
Delete all infected files, instead of just listing them.

/DISINF
Disinfect whenever possible - deletes first-generation samples and files
destroyed by overwriting viruses.  It will never delete a file which can
be disinfected.

/DOC
Scan Word documents.

/EXT=
Specify which filename extensions to scan by default, maximum of 10,
separated by "."  Example: /EXT=COM.EXE.SYS.DLL.OV?

/FILE (default) /NOFILE
Scan/Don't scan files.  If /NOFILE is used, it implies /NOPACKED and
/NOUSER as well.

/GURU
Provides additional information while scanning.

/HARD
Scans the MBR and all accessible partitions on any hard disks that are
found.

/HELP or /?
Display a list of available options.

/INTER
Force interactive mode.

/LIST
Produce a report of all files checked, not just those which are infected.

/MONO
Use monochrome on color displays.

/MULTI
Scan multiple diskettes.

/NET
Scans any network "drives" found.

/NOBREAK
Disables ESC and ^C during scanning

/NODOC
Do not scan Word documents.

/NOMEM
Skip the memory scan.

/NOSUB
Do not scan subdirectories.

/NOWRAP
Do not wrap text in the report.

/OLD
Do not display the "This version of the program is rather old" message.

/ONLY 
When used with /ANALYSE, it will make F-PROT perform ONLY a heuristic
scan.

/PACKED (default) /NOPACKED
Search/Don't search inside packed executables (DIET, PKLITE, LZEXE).  This
does not mean that F-PROT will scan inside archives (ZIP or ARJ).

/PAGE
Pause after each page.

/PARANOID
Makes the scanner totally paranoid.  Increases the chances of picking
up new viruses, but will significantly increase the risk of false
positives.  Only recommended for use by experienced, technical-minded
users, and please keep in mind that we are not interested in receiving
samples of possible false alarms that are only produced when this switch
is used.

/RENAME
Rename infected files to *.VOM, *.VXE or *.VVV.

/REPORT=file
Sends the output to a file, in addition to displaying it on the screen.

/SILENT
Generates no screen output at all - useful if you want to run the program
from a batch file, and only check the return code.

/USER /NOUSER (default)
Search/Don't search for user-defined search strings.  This option should
only be used if absolutely neccessary, as it may result in a considerable
speed decrease.

                          Return status

The program uses the following exit codes, which can be checked with the
ERRORLEVEL command from a BAT file.

    0 - Normal exit - nothing found
    1 - Abnormal termination - unrecoverable error.  This can mean any of
	the following:
	    DOS version 1.x was used (F-PROT requires DOS 2.0 or higher)
	    The report file (specified with /REPORT=) could not be created.
	    ENGLISH.TX0 or SIGN.DEF corrupted or not present
	    Program was run from a diskette, and the diskette then changed.
    2 - Selftest failed - program has been modified.
    3 - A Boot/File virus infection found.
    4 - Virus search string found in memory.
    5 - Program terminated with ^C or ESC.
    6 - At least one virus was removed.  This code is only meaningful if
        the program is used to scan just a single file.
    7 - Insufficient memory to run the program.
    8 - At least one suspicious file was found, but no infections.
