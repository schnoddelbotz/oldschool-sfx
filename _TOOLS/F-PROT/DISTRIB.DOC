                 Restrictions on the distribution of F-PROT

The F-PROT shareware package must always be distributed complete and
without modifications.  We publish a detached PGP signature for the entire
package, and any modifications to the file will invalidate that signature.

The only authorized modification involves the file available from the
Garbo FTP site.  We can accept the modification, as we upload the file
directly there.  However, because of this modification, the PGP signature
cannot be used to check the file available on Garbo. 

Any other modifications to the package, including the addition of BBS
advertisements are strictly forbidden - we want to be able to assure the
users of our package that the product they receive is identical to the one
we released.

Mass distribution of F-PROT in magazines or books requires approval from us
or (in countries where we do not license the shareware version) the
relevant local distributor of F-PROT Professional.  The same restriction
applies to "bundling" of F-PROT with other products, including distribution
as a part of a larger package or pre-installation on hard disks.

F-PROT shareware may be made available on FTP and BBS sites, as well as
included on CD-ROMs containing other shareware/freeware programs, such as
the SIMTEL and GARBO collection CD-ROMs, provided the conditions below
are not violated.  

Any distribution of F-PROT is subject to the following restrictions:

We do not want to have F-PROT distributed together with viruses, virus
source code, virus construction programs or virus creation material such as
40Hex, Crypt or the Nuke newsletters.  Therefore,

  1) F-PROT may not under any circumstances be made available on a site
     which makes such material freely available.

  2) F-PROT may not be included on a CD-ROM (or similar media) containing
     such material.

  3) F-PROT may not be distributed as a part of a package containing
     such material.

We will consider legal action in the case of any violation of those three
conditions.
