                     F-MACROW Last Minute Release Notes

WARNING! This is a BETA version of our new macro scanner/disinfector.
We made it available because of the increased demand for a good document
disinfection program and because we were not satisfied with the quality of
the previous (DOS) versions of the F-MACRO.EXE program.  However, we have
not had the time to put F-MACROW through the extensive internal tests which
our products usually undergo.  Therefore, there is increased probability
that the program is not entirely bug-free.  The users are strongly advised
to make backup copies of the documents before attempting to disinfect them. 
This is particularly important when disinfecting Excel workbooks, since
Microsoft failed to provide us with the information we needed to implement
proper Excel virus disinfection.

If any bugs are found, please report them to bontchev@complex.is, and if
you have any suggestions for improvements - feel free to e-mail to the
above address.

F-MACROW is a 16-bit Windows application. It has been tested
successfully under Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Windows 95 and Windows
NT (3.51 and 4.0 beta 2), although it should work under plain Windows
3.1 as well. It does not work under DOS - but then, if you do not run
Windows the you do not have to worry about these viruses anyhow.

Installation.

To install F-MACROW, follow the simple procedure described below. (Future
versions will include an automatic installation program.)

1) Copy the file CTL3DV2.DLL to your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, if it is
not there already (the file is probably already in place).

2) The program needs the file OLE2.DLL in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory
too. However, if this file is not already on your system, WinWord 6.x or
above will not run, so macro viruses are not your concern.

3) Copy the files F-MACROW.EXE and MACRO.DEF in some directory (e.g.,
in the same directory where you have installed F-PROT). It doesn't
matter where they are placed but both of them must be in the same directory.

4) Create an item in some Program Manager group and make it point to the
file F-MACROW.EXE. (Alternatively, if you are using Windows 95, simply
drag the file from the Explorer and drop it on the desktop.)

Using F-MACROW

Once you have installed the required files you can launch the program by
double-clicking the F-MACROW icon.  Windows 95 users can also launch it
from the DOS prompt in a DOS box.

The program interface is very simple.  The user clicks on the Scan button to
start the scanning.  This brings up a dialog box, where the user can select
scanning options.

The following options are available:

Scan directory        - Selects the directory to be scanned.
What to scan          - Selects whether to scan files with standard extensions
                        for Word and Excel (*.DOC, *.DOT, *.XL?), or whether to
                        scan files with any extension.
Scan Subdirectories   - Whether to scan subdirectories of the specified
                        directory.
If a virus is found   - Specifies what action should be taken if a virus is
                        found.  The following options are available:
                          - Report only.  Just reports the virus.
                          - Disinfect automatically. The virus will be
                            automatically removed.
                          - Ask each time.  The user will be asked each time
                            if the file should be disinfected.
Report all scanned
documents              - Normally the program will report only the files in
                         which a virus is found.  If this option is checked,
                         all scanned files will be reported.
Report file            - Check this option if you wish to save the report to a
                         file, and use the next two fields to specify the name
                         of the report file and whether the new report should
                         overwrite an already existing file or append to it.

When the desired options have been selected, press the OK button to start
the scan.  The scanning can be stopped by pressing ESC or clicking the Stop
button.

To exit the program click on the Exit button.

The on-line help option has not yet been implemented.
