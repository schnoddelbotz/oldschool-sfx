                          Installation 

Installation of F-PROT involves copying all the files which make up the
package to a separate directory on the hard disk or on a network server.
One line is then added to AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS to load the
VIRSTOP.EXE program - see VIRSTOP.DOC for further information

Earlier versions of F-PROT offered semi-automatic installation, but it was
very limited - only allowed loading VIRSTOP from AUTOEXEC, and did not
work on networked machines. 

We came to the conclusion that the installation should be handled with a
dedicated "INSTALL" program and such a program now exists for the
Professional version.
