US$20 per year.

                 1 - 2500     $1.00 per computer ($20 minimum)
              2501 - 5000     $0.75 per computer
              5001 - 7500     $0.50 per computer

             10001 and up     call for information

Example: A license for 4500 computers would be

                2500 computers at $1.00   $2500
                2000 computers at $0.75   $1500
                                         
         which gives a total of $4000 per year

The customer is not expected to keep accurate count of the number of computers
which the software is installed on, only to provide a reasonable estimate.

If you just order a site license, we assume that you already have the
program, and that you will be obtaining new versions of the program by FTP
or download them from bulletin boards.  In this case, all you receive from
us is just an invoice and a paper copy of the license, if requested.  If
you need a diskette with the latest version, please add $20 (or $100 for a
1-year subscription).

                            EDUCATIONAL DISCOUNT

There is a 25% educational discount of the license fee, although the $20
minimum fee still applies.  There is no charge for the use of the program
on computers personally owned by students/staff.  This discount does not
apply to the subscription fee.


                             OBTAINING UPDATES

There is no additional fee for updates if they are obtained from BBSes,
from CompuServe, AOL or other such services, or via FTP from one of the
Internet archive servers, such as oak.oakland.edu.  Please see the file
UPDATES.DOC for a list of FTP distribution sites.

If you cannot use any of those options, we offer a bimonthly mail-update
service, for a fixed annual fee of US$100, added to the license fee.

should be either in Icelandic kronor, or your own currency - not a third

would be $25.

Canadian bank, please make sure the check states that it is payable through
some US bank.  If the check is drawn on an US$ account in a Canadian bank,
and no mention made of an US bank, it can only be cashed in Canada and the
US - we would have to return it.  

Please do not send payment in the form of an US Postal Money Order - it
cannot be cashed in Iceland.
