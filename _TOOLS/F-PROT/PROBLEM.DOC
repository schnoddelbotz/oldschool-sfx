                    Known problems with F-PROT

The following compatibility problems are known at the moment, and will be
fixed as soon as possible.

    VIRSTOP is not compatible with the Cyrix 486SLC processor because of a
    "bug" in the Cyrix chip - it is not 100% compatible with Intel
    processors.  This problem can be bypassed by using the /NOTRACE
    command-line switch.

    VIRSTOP may under some circumstances not be compatible with the 386Max
    and BlueMax memory managers.  If you have a problem, use the /NOTRACE
    command-line switch.

    VIRSTOP.EXE is not effective if run before a program which totally takes
    over the "Load-and-Execute" function.  This includes Novell Netware and
    PC-NFS, and as explained elsewhere, VIRSTOP should be run after those
    programs, or run again with the /REHOOK command-line switch, after
    those programs are loaded.

    Occasionally, when using Novell Netware and Windows 3.0 with VIRSTOP
    installed, and an attempt is made to send anything to a HP laser
    printer over the network, from inside certain Windows applications, the
    output may become garbled.  The reason for this is not known, but as
    several other TSR's are known to cause the same problem, this is
    probably not a F-PROT problem.  This can be solved by using LPT1.OS2
    instead of LPT1 as the printer port.  This bug seems to have been fixed
    in Windows 3.1

The following problem is not likely to go away in the near future:

    If F-PROT is run from a diskette, the diskette may not be removed while
    the program is running, so other diskettes cannot be inserted for
    scanning.  The reason is that F-PROT stores all its text messages in a
    separate file, and needs to be able to access that file while running. 
    The recommended solution is to copy the package to the hard disk or a
    RAM-disk, if you need to scan diskettes.
