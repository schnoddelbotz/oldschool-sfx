The F-PROT anti-virus package consists of several files, which are:

        F-PROT.EXE    the main program
        SIGN.DEF      virus search strings
        *.TX0         language files for various languages

	(the files above are essential, and must be present if
	you are for example running F-PROT from a floppy disk).

        VIRSTOP.EXE   the virus-intercepting program.
	VIRSTOP2.EXE  a new (experimental) version.
        VIR-HELP.*    virus information in various languages
        *.DOC         information about viruses and the package
        F-TEST.COM    used to test if VIRSTOP is properly installed
        FILE_ID.DIZ   a BBS description file
        VIRLIST.LIS   a list of the viruses F-PROT detects
        *.ASC         PGP signature files

	F-MACROW.EXE  the Windows macro virus scanner
        MACRO.DEF     database for the macro scanner
        CTL3DV2.DLL   necessary for the macro scanner

The function of VIRSTOP.EXE is to intercept known viruses - it will
prevent the execution of any program infected with any of the viruses
it recognizes. See VIRSTOP.DOC for a description of this program.

The other program, F-PROT.EXE provides virus scanning, disinfection and
information.  To run it, just give the command

                        F-PROT <enter>

If F-PROT.EXE is run from a diskette it might appear rather slow, but then
it is safe from being infected by a virus - provided the diskette is write-
protected, of course.

F-PROT first performs a self-test, to see if it has been infected with a
virus, and then it loads the search strings into memory.  The next step is
to search for viruses in memory, but this can be disabled with the /NOMEM
command-line switch, if you are absolutely sure no virus is present.

You will then be greeted by a screen which shows the available functions:

                        Scan
                        Configure
                        Viruses
                        Program
                        Quit

As a detailed description of some of the functions is provided in separate
.DOC files, they are only described briefly here.

Scan (see SCAN.DOC): Searches for viruses, using a large (and growing) set
of virus search strings.  The user can select where to search, and choose
between three different search modes.

Configure (see INSTALL.DOC):  This option very limited configuration of
the program, but is due for a re-design in the near future.

Viruses: When this function is selected, a new menu appears with a couple
of virus-related functions.  One is 'Information', which provides information
on viruses - a description of their size, behaviour, origin and other
facts which may be of interest.  The second option allows the user to enter
a search string for a new virus.  This should only be necessary between the
discovery of a totally new virus and the arrival of an updated version of
F-PROT.
        
Program: Answers to some common questions, such as how to obtain updates
and how to contact the author.  Also an attempt to answer the persistent
question of how many viruses F-PROT will detect.

Quit: Exit from the program
