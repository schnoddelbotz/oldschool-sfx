What is a computer virus ?

Well, the best definition we have been able to come up with is the
following 4-part one:

   #1 A virus is a program that is able to replicate, that is create
      (possibly modified) copies of itself.

   #2 The replication is intentional, not just a side-effect.  

   #3 At least some of replicants in turn are also viruses by the same
      definition.

   #4 A virus has to attach itself to a "host", in the sense that
      execution of the host implies execution of the virus.  

#1 distinguishes viruses from non-replicating malware, such as Trojans,
ANSI bombs and logic Bombs.

#2 distinguishes between viruses and programs such as DISKCOPY.COM
that can replicate.

#3 is needed to exclude certain "intended viruses", that attempt to
replicate, but fail - they simply do not qualify as "real" viruses.

#4 is necessary to distinguish between viruses and worms, which do not
require a host.

A Trojan is a program that pretends to do something useful (or at least
interesting), but when it is run, it may have some harmful effect, like
scrambling your FAT (File Allocation Table) or formatting the hard disk.

Viruses and Trojans may contain a "time-bomb", intended to destroy
programs or data on a specific date or when some condition has been
fulfilled.

A time bomb is often designed to be harmful, maybe doing something like
formatting the hard disk.  Sometimes it is relatively harmless, perhaps 
slowing the computer down every Friday or making a ball bounce around the
screen.  However, there is really no such thing as a harmless virus.  Even if
a virus has been intended to cause no damage, it may do so in certain cases,
often due to the incompetence of the virus writer or unexpected hardware
or software revisions.

A virus may be modified, either by the original author or someone else, so
that a more harmful version of it appears.  It is also possible that the
modification produces a less harmful virus, but that has only rarely
happened.

The damage caused by a virus may consist of the deletion of data or
programs, maybe even reformatting of the hard disk, but more subtle damage
is also possible.  Some viruses may modify data or introduce typing errors
into text.  Other viruses may have no intentional effects other than just
replicating.

The major groups of viruses on PCs are boot sector viruses (BSV), program
viruses and application viruses.

A BSV infects boot sectors on diskettes and/or hard disks.  On diskettes, 
the boot sector normally contains code to load the operating system files. 
The BSV replaces the original boot sector with itself and stores the
original boot sector somewhere else on the diskette or simply replaces it
totally.  When a computer is then later booted from this diskette, the
virus takes control and hides in RAM.  It will then load and execute the
original boot sector, and from then on everything will be as usual. 
Except, of course, that every diskette inserted in the computer will be
infected with the virus, unless it is write-protected.

A BSV will usually hide at the top of memory, reducing the amount of
memory that the DOS sees.  For example, a computer with 640K might appear
to have only 639K.

Most BSVs are also able to infect hard disks, where the process is similar
to that described above, although they usually infect the master boot
record instead of the DOS boot record.

Program viruses, the second type of computer viruses, infect executable
programs, usually .COM and .EXE files, but sometimes also overlay files,
device drivers or even object files.
 
An infected program will contain a copy of the virus, usually at the end,
in some cases at the beginning of the original program, and in a few cases
the virus is inserted in the middle of the original program.

When an infected program is run, the virus may stay resident in memory
and infect every program run.  Viruses using this method to spread the
infection are called "Resident Viruses".

Other viruses may search for a new file to infect, when an infected
program is executed.  The virus then transfers control to the original
program.  Viruses using this method to spread the infection are
called "Direct Action Viruses".  It is possible for a virus to use both
methods of infection.

Most viruses try to recognize existing infections, so they do not infect
what has already been infected.  This makes it possible to inoculate
against specific viruses, by making the "victim" appear to be infected.
However, this method is useless as a general defense, as it is not 
possible to inoculate the same program against multiple viruses.

The third type of viruses are application viruses, which do not infect
normal programs, but instead spread as "macros" in various types of files,
typically word-processor documents or spreadsheets.

In general, viruses are just program - rather unusual programs perhaps,
but written just like any other program.  It does not take a genius to
write one - any average assembly language programmer can easily do it. 
Fortunately, few of them do.

Now - to correct some common misconceptions, here are a few bits of
information about what viruses cannot do.

        A virus cannot appear all by itself, it has to be written, just
        like any other program.
        
        Not all viruses are intentionally harmful - some may only cause
	minor damage as a side effect - however, there is no such thing
	as a "harmless" virus.

	Reading data from an infected diskette cannot cause an infection.

        A write-protected diskette cannot become infected, if the
	hardware is working properly.

It used to be the case that a virus could not infect a computer unless it
was booted from an infected diskette or an infected program was run on it,
but alas, this is no longer true.  It is possible for a virus infection to
spread, just by the act of reading an infected Microsoft Word document,
for example, or through use of Lotus Notes, to name two well-known
applications.

It also used to be the case that a virus could not infect data files or
spread from one type of computer to another - a virus designed to infect
Macintosh computers could not infect PCs or vice versa, but with the
appearance of application viruses this has changed as well - there are now
a few viruses that can infect WinWord as well as MacWord.

Apart from using anti-virus programs, there are several ways to protect
your computer from viruses:

        Rule #1 is: MAKE BACKUPS!!!  Keep good backups (more than one) of
        everything you do not want to lose.  This will not only protect you
        from serious damage caused by viruses, but is also necessary in the
        case of a serious hardware failure.

        Never boot a computer with a hard disk from a diskette because that
        is the only way the hard disk could become infected with a BSV.
        (well, strictly speaking, it can happen if you run a "dropper"
        program too, but that happens extremely rarely).

	If your BIOS allows you to change the boot sequence to "C: A:",
	do it. This will give you very good protection against boot
 	sector virus infections.

        Should you, by accident, have left a non-bootable diskette in
        drive A: when you turn the computer on, the message

                        Not a system disk.

        may appear.  If the diskette was infected with a virus, it will now
        be active, but may not have infected the hard disk yet. if this
        happens, turn the computer off, or press the reset button.  It is
        important to note that pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del will not be sufficient,
        as a few viruses can survive that.

        If the computer has no hard disk, but is booted from a diskette,
        you should always use the same diskette, and keep it write-protected.

        Keep all diskettes write-protected unless you need to write to them.
        When you obtain new software on a diskette, write-protect the
        diskette before you make a backup copy of it.  If it is not possible
        to make a backup of the diskette, because of some idiotic
        copy-protection, I do not recommend using the software.

        Be really careful regarding your sources of software.  In general,
        shrink-wrapped commercial software should be "clean", but there
        have been a few documented cases of infected commercial software.
        Public-Domain, Freeware and Shareware packages do not have to be
        any more dangerous - it all depends on the source.  If you obtain
        software from a BBS, check what precautions the SysOp takes against
        viruses.  If he does not screen the software made available for
        downloading, you should find another source.

        Check all new software for infection before you run it for the
        first time.  It is even advisable to use a couple of scanners from
        different manufacturers, as no single scanner is able to detect
        all viruses.

        Obtain Shareware, Freeware and Public-Domain software from the
        original author or reliable distribution sites, if at all possible.  

        Look out for any "unusual" behavior on your computer, like:

                Does it take longer than usually to load programs ?
                Do unusual error messages appear ?
                Does the memory size seem to have decreased ?
                Do the disk lights stay on longer than they used to ?
                Do files just disappear ?

Anything like this might indicate a virus infection.

If your computer is infected with a virus - DON'T PANIC!  Sometimes a
badly thought out attempt to remove a virus will do much more damage
than the virus could have done.  If you are not sure what to do, leave
your computer turned off until you find someone to remove the virus for
you.

Finally, remember that some viruses may interfere with the disinfection
operation if they are active in memory at that time, so before attempting
to disinfect you MUST boot the computer from a CLEAN system diskette.

It is also a good idea to boot from a clean system diskette before
scanning for viruses, as several "stealth" viruses are very difficult do
detect if they are active in memory during virus scanning.
