                Audience instructions are in brackets.  Text in quotes          
                is to be shouted.  The instruction 'Echo' means that the        
                following line is to be shouted in unison with the film.

                the line "Asshole!" is appropriate.                             
                When Janet is introduced or appears, the line "Slut!" is        
                appropriate, or you prefer...                                   
                the line "Nice" (Nissss)is appropriate too.  Whenever

                "Bo-ring!","Charles Gray, he's O.K.!".  Dr. Scott may be        
                booed, but it's also appropriate to yell "Kiss Ass!".

Brad:       Hi! My name is Brad Majors, and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.    
            I wonder if you could help us.  You see, our car broke down         
            a few miles up the road... do you have a phone we might use?

Janet:      {"How kind is he?"} You're too kind. {"No, he's not"}               
            Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of a place is this?
