     New to ARJ 2.50 is a feature that allows a programmer to use ARJ,
     DEARJ, or ARJSFX within an application in such a way as to allow the
     programmer significant control over the ARJ display output.

     It is possible to inhibit all ARJ/DEARJ/ARJSFX screen output and to
     build a display program that ARJ/DEARJ/ARJSFX will use to display a
     graphical output of the installation progress.  This will produce a
     more professional looking application.

     The main drawback to this new display feature is that of speed. There
     is a loss of extraction speed when processing archives with many small
     files.  For single diskette archives, this should not be a problem.

     To see how all this works in practice, you should execute the
     ARJDISP.BAT batch file and follow its instructions.  This feature is
     also available in the large ARJSFX (self-extractor) module and in
     DEARJ.EXE.  This feature is NOT available in the ARJSFXV (multiple
     volume) self-extractor and the small ARJSFXJR modules.

     The C source code for the ARJ$DISP.EXE program is provided to
     ARJ licensees as part of the licensee ARJ software diskette.

     Please note that the use of ARJ in a business, government, or
     institutional environment requires either an internal use license or
     a distribution license.
