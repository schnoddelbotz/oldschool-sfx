     The following error messages may appear when using ARJ.  A brief
     explanation of each message follows:


     <filename> does not exist

         The file <filename> could not be found on the disk.

         This error may occur in a multiple volume extraction if ARJ is
         trying to extract a split file.  If this split file is not the
         beginning of the file, ARJ will look for the beginning of the
         file on the disk. If this file is missing, ARJ will report this
         error.

         This error will also occur during an extraction to freshen
         existing files.


     <filename> exists

	 The file <filename> already exists on the disk.


     <filename> is not an ARJ archive

	 The file <filename> does not have a valid ARJ archive header in
	 the initial portion of the file.  This file may not be an ARJ
	 archive or it may be damaged.


     <filename> is not the same date/time

	 The file <filename> that is being appended to does not have the
	 correct file date-time stamp.	This message occurs during multiple
	 volume extraction when the portion of the file on disk does not
	 match the portion in the archive.  This can happen if a multiple
	 volume extraction was interrupted by a "quit" response.


     <filename> is same or newer

	 The file <filename> has the same or newer file date-time stamp
	 than the matching file in the archive.


     Archive name argument missing

	 The ARJ command is missing the name of the ARJ archive filename.


     Arg table overflow

	 There are more than 64 arguments on the ARJ command line.


     *** Valid ARJ-SECURITY envelope signature:

	 This message is displayed when ARJ has verified that the archive
	 has a valid ARJ-SECURITY envelope.  This indicates that the archive
	 contents are intact and unmodified as originally distributed by the
	 individual identified in the text that follows this message.


     Bad command syntax

	 The ARJ command line is not correct syntactically.


     Bad file data

	 The file in the ARJ archive is damaged and has invalid data in it.
	 It is not possible to recover this file in an undamaged format.


     Bad file data or bad password

	 The file in the ARJ archive is damaged or you may have supplied
	 the wrong password to the "-g" option.  Check the password that
	 you specified.


     Bad header

	 The ARJ archive file description information record is damaged.


     Bad or missing SECURITY key

	 An invalid or missing security key was provided to ARJ.  Check
	 to see if the security key is correct.


     Break signaled

	 The user pressed Control C or Control BREAK.


     Can't copy temp <filename> to archive <filename>

	 This error usually means that there is not enough disk space to
	 copy the intermediate archive file to its destination drive. ARJ
	 does not purge the intermediate archive file in this situation so
	 that the file can be copied manually to a drive with enough disk
	 space.


     Can't delete <filename>

	 ARJ cannot delete the file <filename>.  Most likely, the file is
	 in use or is set as readonly.


     Can't find <filename>

	 The file <filename> does not exist.


     Can't find restart file: <filename>

	 The file <filename> does not exist.


     Can't find restart information

	 During the scan of the specified index file, ARJ could not find
	 a line of text similar to the following:

	 Next volume - 001 1	  19931 C:\ARC\VGA640.DRV

	 This can happened if the index file is damaged or was created by
	 a version of ARJ prior to 2.39.


     Can't get volume label

	 ARJ could not read the volume label of the drive specified.


     Can't handle ARJ-SECURITY version <number>

	 This version of ARJ encountered an ARJ-SECURITY envelope version
	 of which it does not know how to verify the integrity.


     Can't make directory <directoryname>

	 ARJ could not create the directory <directoryname>.  The name
	 <directoryname> may already exist.


     Can't open <filename>

	 ARJ cannot open the file <filename>.  The file may be set to
	 readonly or it may already be in use.


     Can't order a multiple volume archive

	 Re-ordering a multiple volume archive is NOT allowed.


     Can't read file or unexpected end of file

	 This error message usually occurs if the end of the file has been
	 reached when ARJ is expecting more data.


     Can't rename <filename> to <filename>

	 ARJ could not rename <filename>.  The target filename may already
	 exist.


     Can't reset <filename>

	 ARJ could not reset the archive bit attribute of <filename>.


     Can't seek to position <number> in file

	 ARJ could not seek to the position in the file.  This file may not
	 be as large as the position specified.


     Can't update an ARJ-SECURED archive!

	 Modification of an ARJ-SECURED archive is NOT allowed.


     Can't use -jt1 or -jt2 with -e or -e1

	 ARJ always uses the filename stored in the archive to access the
	 file during the compare operation.  The -e and -e1 options strip
	 significant information from the filename.


     Can't use -v with -je1

         The small self-extraction module does not support multiple volume
	 archives.


     Can't write file. Disk full?

	 Self-explanatory.


     CRC error

	 The file in the ARJ archive is damaged and has invalid data in it.
	 It is not possible to recover this file in an undamaged format.

	 If this error is encountered when ARJ initially starts up, this
	 indicates that the ARJ runfile is probably damaged.


     Critical device error

	 A DOS critical error has occurred.  ARJ has trapped this error
	 condition and returned a error.


     *** Damaged ARJ-SECURED archive!

	 This ARJ archive has been damaged or corrupted.  The contents of
	 the archive are not in the same condition as when it was created.


     Delete argument missing

	 The ARJ delete command requires that a filename or wildspec be
	 specified on the command line.  It does not assume "*.*".


     *** Detected an OBSOLETE ARJ-SECURITY envelope.  NOT verified!

	 ARJ has detected a version 1 ARJ-SECURITY envelope.  ARJ has not
	 verified the validity of the ARJ-SECURITY envelope because of
	 the obsolescence of version 1 envelopes.


     Exceeded maximum path size of <number> at <filename>

	 The maximum pathname length is limited in size to <number>
	 characters.


     Exceeded name limit of <number> at <filename>

	 The number of filenames encountered by ARJ has exceeded the
	 documented limited of <number> filenames.


     File is password encrypted

	 ARJ is skipping the current file because it is password encrypted
	 (garbled) and no password has been specified on the command line
	 with the "-g" option.


     Found <number> error(s)

	 ARJ has encountered <number> of non-fatal errors.


     Garbled files are not allowed for SFXJR

	 The small self-extractor module does not support the extraction of
	 garbled files.


     Header CRC error

	 The file description header record in the archive is damaged.
	 This cannot be fixed.	The use of the "-jr" option will allow the
	 recovery of files after the damaged section.


     Invalid command: <command>

	 The specified <command> is not a valid ARJ command.


     Invalid comment header

	 This error should never happen.


     Invalid date string: <date>

	 The date <date> contains an invalid date.  It should be specified
	 in YYMMDDHHMMSS format where YY represents the two digit year, MM
	 represents the month, DD represents the day, HH represents the
	 hour, MM represents the minutes, and SS represents the seconds.


     Invalid multiple volume file sequence

	 ARJ has detected a sequence error in a series of multiple volume
	 archives.  This error should never occur.


     Invalid parameter string: <parameter>

	 The parameter string <parameter> is not correct syntactically.


     Invalid switch: <option>

	 The switch option <option> is not a valid option.


     Invalid use of self-extraction switch

	 The -je or -je1 switch was used with a non-modification command.


     Invalid volume size

	 The specified volume size was too small.  Only 360, 720, 1200, and
	 1440 are acceptable abbreviations.


     Missing filename argument for <command>

	 A filename must be specified for <command>.


     Multiple volume updates are NOT supported

	 The modification of ARJ multiple volume archives is not supported
	 or recommended.  You can use the "-vu" option to override this
	 prohibition.  Do so at your own risk.


     Must specify only non-wildnames for order command

	 The ARJ order command does not accept wildcards.


     NOT found

	 This message is displayed when the filename in the archive is not
	 found on disk.


     NOT matched

	 This message is displayed when the contents of the filename in the
	 archive does not match the contents of the same filename on disk.


     No available memory to store <filename>

	 ARJ has run out of memory and cannot store the name <filename>.
	 Specifying fewer filenames or using a listfile are two ways to
	 work around the lack of memory.

         The new "-hm" option sets ARJ to use disk space to store this list
         of filenames thus avoiding this memory problem.


     Nothing to do

	 This message is displayed if you try to restart a multiple volume
	 archival process that did not abort but actually completed.


     No strings were entered

	 At least one search string must be specified for the ARJ "w"
	 command.


     Not a valid method for SFX

	 The ARJ self-extraction modules do not support extraction of files
	 compressed with the "-m4" option.


     Not enough disk space for extraction. Overflow by over <number> bytes.

	 Self-explanatory.


     Not enough disk space

	 Self-explanatory.


     Not enough free disk space

	 Self-explanatory.


     Order command file count mismatch

	 This error should not happen.	Please report this problem.


     Out of memory

	 There is not enough memory for ARJ to complete its operation.


     Out of near memory

	 There is not enough small model memory for ARJ to complete its
	 operation.  It can occur if there is a large amount of environment
	 space allocated to environment variables.  The use of "COMMAND /C
	 /E:200 ARJ <command> ... " can work around this problem.


     Password option missing

	 The "-g" option requires the specification of a password.


     Passwords did not match

	 The two passwords entered did not match exactly.


     Read/Write error <message> on drive <letter>


     Set label error

	 ARJ could not set the volume label to the volume label stored in
	 the archive.  This can happen if the volume label in the archive
	 is not a standard DOS volume label.


     Signal failed

	 This error should not happen.	Please report this problem.


     Skipping a possible ARJ-SECURED archive

	 This message is displayed when the option (-he1) has been specified
	 and ARJ has just accessed an ARJ archive that has an ARJ-SECURITY
	 envelope on it.  This does NOT indicate the validity or integrity
	 of the ARJ-SECURITY envelope.


     Text mode (-t1) files are not allowed for SFXJR

	 The ARJ small self-extraction module (-je1) does not support
	 extraction of files compressed in text mode (-t1).


     The ARJ-SECURITY envelope on this archive has been violated

	 This ARJ archive has been damaged or corrupted.  The contents of
	 the archive are not in the same condition as when it was created.


     This archive HAS a valid ARJ-SECURITY envelope

	 This ARJ archive has been ARJ-SECURED and most probably is in the
	 same condition as when it was created.


     Unknown file type: <number>

	 ARJ has encountered an unknown file type in the archive.
	 You may need a newer version of ARJ to process this archive.


     Unknown method: <number>

	 ARJ has encountered an unknown compression method in the archive.
	 You may need a newer version of ARJ to process this archive.


     Unknown version: <number>

	 ARJ has encountered an unknown extraction version in the archive.
	 You may need a newer version of ARJ to process this archive.


     *** Verifying ARJ SECURITY envelope ...

	 ARJ is testing the integrity of the ARJ-SECURITY envelope on the
	 archive.  If the envelope has been corrupted or damaged, ARJ will
	 display a message to that effect.

     Volume labels are not allowed for SFX

	 The ARJ self-extraction modules do not support the extraction of
	 volume labels.


     Warning! Only <number> bytes of free disk space. Continue?

	 Self-explanatory.
