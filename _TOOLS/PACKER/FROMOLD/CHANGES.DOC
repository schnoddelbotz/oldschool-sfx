
				NEW IN V1.4

	1. Wildcards permitted as the input file specification.

	2. Default output file path: is now the current directory, not
	   the directory of the source file.

	3. Input files are now opened read-only, so that the message
	   "access denied" no longer appears when trying to read from
	   read-only devices, such as CD-ROMs.

   				NEW IN V2.0

	4. New encoding technique permits construction of very compact
	   object libraries; also, 16-bit files can now be compressed.

   				NEW IN V2.1

	5. The compression techniques of V1.4 and V2.0 have been combined
	   into this release.

	6. The -o0 command-line option now finds the globally best value
	   of order for each frame.  It used to find only a "locally"
	   optimal value.

	7. The -x option checks the spectral content of audio files two
	   different ways, and uses the one that achieves the higher
	   compression ratio.  A math coprocessor is not required but is
	   nevertheless highly recommended.

	8. A new compression after-pass is now applied by default, which
	   increases compression, especially in files which contain long
	   sequences of flat zero-crossing signal.  This after-pass is
	   disabled by the "-E" option, however.

                                NEW IN V2.1a

        9. Columnar screen output.

       10. Bug fix which sometimes prevented -o0 from finding globally
	   best value of order.

       11. File extension specified for output file now obeyed instead
           of ignored.

	                        NEW IN V2.1b

       12. Option -E extended to allow -ER, which re-enables the RLE
           afterpass over the compressed frames.  Release of RLE.OBJ
	   and UN_RLE.OBJ to licensed Evaluators.

	                        NEW IN V2.1c

       13. Special-order version for one customer, which extends the
           range of the lossy parameter.

   	                        NEW IN V2.1d

       14. Fixed bug which occasionally caused an underflow run-time
           error.

       15. Fixed bug which kept -x option from operating on 16-bit data.

       				NEW IN V2.1e

       16. Fixed bug which frequently caused a system lockup or re-boot
           when processing 16-bit files.

	   			NEW IN V2.1f

       17. Changed copyright notice and address of Speech Compression.

       18. Changes to "lossy" algorithm which slow it down some more (sigh)
           but which increase the quality and compression percentages.

                                NEW IN V2.1g

       19. Fixed bug which caused an incorrect RIFF length to be reported
           when a LIST or other chunk follows the data chunk in a WAV file.

	   			NEW IN V2.1h

       20. Revamped the spectral analysis of 16-big data when -X option is
           not specified.  Some 16-bit files compress substantially better.

       21. Fixed bug which prevented old RIFF length from being restored due
           to garbage data after end of RIFF/WAVE data.

       22. Sonarc now handles extra byte(s) at the end of a VOC file (some-
           times added to bring the length of the file up to an even number).

       23. Sonarc now recognizes an obsolete v1.00 VOC format.
