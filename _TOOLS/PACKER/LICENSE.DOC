
     ARJ LICENSE POLICY                                       October 1995


     The ARJ archiver, the REARJ program, the ARJSFX module, the ARJSFXJR
     module, the ARJSFXV module, the ARJ$DISP program, the DEARJ program,
     the ARJR program, and the associated documentation are copyright (c)
     1990-95 ARJ Software, all rights reserved.  The ARJ software may not
     be circulated in any incomplete or modified form, nor sold for profit,
     without written permission of the author.

     If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
     distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

     AGENTS.DOC
     ARJ.EXE
     ARJ.DOC

     We strongly prefer that the files be distributed in the format
     originally released: ARJ###.EXE (### = version) with the ARJ-SECURITY
     envelope as created by the author.  If you must distribute the ARJ
     archive in another archive format, please archive the ARJ###.EXE as
     one file inside the other archive.  Re-archival of the software as
     separate files means losing the ARJ security envelope.

     As a brief description of ARJ, we suggest the following:

     "ARJ is a file archiver compresses files into a disk space saving
     archive.  It is fast, reliable, and has a rich set of features which
     include convenient file directory handling, file generations, text
     searching, archive recovery, configurable command options, multiple
     volume archives (archives that span diskettes) and much more."

     You may NOT distribute the registered version of ARJ or the registered
     version of REARJ or any version of ARJR, and DEARJ except as noted in
     your ARJ license agreement.  ARJR is the ARJ program minus the help
     screens and SFX/SFXV/SFXJR modules.  DEARJ is the ARJR program minus
     the archive modification/creation functions.  ARJR and DEARJ are
     available only to registered and licensed users.  See the ORDERFRM.DOC
     for ordering information.  Those who have made donations to ARJ may
     upgrade to a full registration with full credit for your previous
     donation(s).  Please note the previous donation on your order as a
     reminder.

     The use and/or sale of ARJ, ARJR, ARJ$DISP, DEARJ, REARJ, ARJSFX,
     ARJSFXV, and ARJSFXJR (ARJ package) is subject to the following terms:


     PERSONAL USE:

     For personal use (at home and non-commercial), ARJ, ARJSFX, and
     ARJSFXV, ARJSFXJR may be freely used and shared with others.  There is
     no REQUIRED registration fee for non-commercial, non-business,
     non-institutional, non-government personal use.  Instead, we ask that
     you share the ARJ software with a friend.

     For personal use, the program REARJ may be freely used only by ARJ
     users.  An ARJ user is one who uses ARJ on a regular basis.  Others
     who wish to use REARJ must purchase a registration for the ARJ
     package.

     The user who registers receives several benefits:

     * Technical support by telephone, fax or mail.  You can get help
       with any questions or problems you encounter in using ARJ.

     * The REGISTERED full version of ARJ.

     * The latest version of REARJ, ARJR, DEARJ, and UNARJ C source code.
       Most of these are only available to registered users.

     * The non-demo multiple volume self-extraction module.

     * The non-demo self-extract module command line option customization
       feature.

     * The satisfaction of knowing that you are supporting the development
       of good, affordable software.


     BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM (BBS) USE:

     ARJ and REARJ may be freely used on non-commercial computer bulletin
     board systems where ARJ is one of the supported primary archive
     formats.  The use of ARJ and/or REARJ on a BBS where ARJ is not one of
     the supported primary archive formats requires a registration or site
     license.

     Support of ARJ involves allowing ARJ archives as uploads AND making
     ARJ archives available as downloads.

     A subscription BBS is not necessarily considered a COMMERCIAL BBS.  A
     BBS that is operated to make money is considered a COMMERCIAL BBS.  A
     BBS operated by a business for the purposes of the business is
     considered a COMMERCIAL BBS.


     INSTITUTIONAL/COMMERCIAL INTERNAL USE LICENSE/REGISTRATION:

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing to
     use the ARJ software in the course of its internal business must
     purchase an ARJ registration or SITE LICENSE or CORPORATE LICENSE. Any
     individual wishing to use the ARJ software within a corporation,
     institution, government agency or business must purchase an ARJ
     registration or SITE LICENSE or CORPORATE LICENSE. The SITE LICENSE
     and CORPORATE LICENSE are provided for those who want to use ARJ on
     multiple computers.  A sample INTERNAL USE LICENSE for the internal
     use of the ARJ software is included at the end of this document.
     Please see the ORDERFRM.DOC or write for terms.

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business may use
     the unregistered shareware version of ARJ only for evaluation purposes
     and only for a thirty day period.	After the thirty day period, you
     must either register ARJ or discontinue its use.  While you are in the
     process of registering ARJ, you may continue to use the unregistered
     ARJ program until you receive the registered version.

     This internal license does NOT license the inclusion of the ARJ
     software with a hardware/software package that is distributed
     externally.

     For the purposes of this license, a SITE is considered a group of
     computers/users at ONE LOCATION (one street address).  This
     definition of a SITE is subject to change.  The CORPORATE LICENSE
     applies where the SITE LICENSE is insufficient.

     Each computer that uses ARJ, ARJSFX, ARJSFXV, or ARJSFXJR in any way
     requires licensing.  In addition, computers that are being backed up
     with ARJ via a file server require licensing.  For example, if
     computer Z's data is copied to a file server and that file server uses
     ARJ to archive Z's data, then computer Z needs to be licensed for ARJ.

     Examples of institutional or commercial use of ARJ:

     1)  Using ARJ to backup your business programs and/or data.
     2)  Using ARJ to create archives for storing or transporting business
	 data.
     3)  Using ARJ on a company supplied home computer for company
	 business.
     4)  Using ARJ to backup your research programs and/or data.
     5)  Using ARJ on your home business computer for business purposes.

     The above examples should NOT be considered the ONLY types of
     institutional or commercial use of ARJ.


     SHAREWARE DISTRIBUTION USE BY INDIVIDUALS:

     The use of ARJ to create an ARJ format archive (*.ARJ) for the purpose
     of distributing shareware or freeware to computer bulletin board
     systems IS NOT considered commercial use.	However, any other use of
     ARJ in connection with a shareware product IS commercial use.  For
     example, using ARJ to backup shareware source code IS commercial use.

     The inclusion of the ARJSFX/ARJSFXV/ARJSFXJR modules in software to
     create self-extracting ARJ archives that are to be distributed
     requires a distribution license.


     DISTRIBUTION LICENSE:

     Standard ARJ format archives (*.ARJ) may be distributed without a
     license.  The UNARJ.EXE program distributed separately may be freely
     used and distributed without a license.

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing to
     include DEARJ, ARJ$DISP, ARJSFX, ARJSFXV, or ARJSFXJR (self-extracting
     ARJ archives) as an integral part of a software and/or hardware
     package to be distributed externally must purchase a DISTRIBUTION
     LICENSE. The use of ARJ on one computer to build the software and/or
     hardware package is included in the DISTRIBUTION LICENSE.

     The above requirement does NOT apply to those who did NOT initiate
     the inclusion of the ARJ software with the software and/or hardware
     package.

     Please write for terms providing your distribution details:

     1)  Expected distribution numbers in total.
     2)  The approximate value/price of the package.
     3)  A brief description of the software/hardware.
     4)  A description of how ARJ will be used in the distribution.
         In other words, is the self-extractor being used or is ARJ's
         multiple volume (-v) feature required.

     If you wish to use the archiver ARJ or the conversion program REARJ
     in your application software, the pricing is similar to the INTERNAL
     LICENSE price schedule.  Please write for terms.


     RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONAL USE:

     To obtain the donation of a SITE LICENSE and/or DISTRIBUTION LICENSE,
     please write providing details of your organization's religious and
     charitable activities and the intended use for ARJ.  A free license
     will be provided to qualifying organizations.  Qualifications will be
     determined on a purely subjective basis.  Non-qualifying organizations
     can always obtain licenses by purchase.

     Non-religious non-profit organizations promoting causes that do not
     conflict with our personal faith and ethics may also qualify for a
     free license.


     COMMERCIAL SALE:

     Any software dealer or library may distribute the entire ARJ package
     in an unmodified form for a fee as long as the price charged for the
     disk containing ARJ does not exceed US $10.00.  You may NOT distribute
     any version of ARJR or DEARJ (not the same as UNARJ).

     Any software dealer or library may distribute the entire ARJ package
     in an unmodified form when included in a CD-ROM shareware collection.
     Moreover, permission is freely given for the use of the ARJ software
     to view and/or install CD-ROM shareware collections where the entire
     ARJ package is included.  No special license is required nor will a
     special license be granted.

     With these exceptions, the sale of ARJ or its parts for profit,
     either alone or together with other software or hardware, requires a
     licensing agreement possibly providing for royalty payments.  Please
     write for terms.


     UPGRADE POLICY FOR ARJ:

     Registered/licensed users of ARJ may upgrade ARJ to the next DOT
     release (2.1 to 2.2, etc) for a small diskette fee.  See the
     ORDERFRM.DOC for details.  CORPORATE LICENSE holders will get
     unlimited free ARJ upgrades.


     UNARJ SOURCE CODE:

     Available in a separately distributed archive is the program UNARJ.EXE
     and its C source code.  UNARJ is a simple ARJ archive extraction
     program.

     You may freely use, copy, and distribute UNARJ.EXE, provided that no
     fee is charged for such use, copying or distribution.

     This source code is intended to promote the building of utilities to
     support the use of ARJ and ARJ archives.


     ARJ-SECURITY ENVELOPE USE:

     This feature is intended for but not limited to software developers
     who wish to distribute archived software with some assurance that the
     archived software in a validated ARJ-SECURED archive will be secure.
     We reserve the right to limit the distribution of ARJ-SECURITY serial
     codes.

     This feature may ONLY be used by those who have purchased an
     ARJ-SECURITY serial number.

     Please see the ORDERFRM.DOC or write for terms.

     of such damages.  In no event shall the author's liability for any
     damages ever exceed the price paid for the license to use the
     software, regardless of the form of the claim.
