  This archive contains the RAR multifunctional integrated archive manager

                    The RAR Archiver - version 2.00

   RAR features:

 o RAR introduces a NEW and original compression algorithm.  It
   allows higher compression ratios than other PC archiving tools,
   especially on executable files, Object libraries, large text
   files, etc.

 o RAR offers a NEW, optional, compression algorithm highly optimized
   for multimedia data.

 o RAR offers NEW facilities and features such as a full-screen
   interactive interface utilizing mouse and menus as well as the
   command line interface.

 o RAR provides functionality for creating a 'solid' archive, which
   can raise the compression ratio by 10% - 50% over more common
   methods, particularly when packing large numbers of small files.

 o RAR gives the user, using the full-screen mode, the ability to
   manage non-RAR archives (.ZIP, .ARJ, .LZH).  The user may view
   update, transform to self-extracting (SFX) archive, add and
   erase comments, specify temporary work directory, etc.

 o RAR offers the ability to create and change SFX archives using
   default and external SFX modules, e.g. the installation SFX.

 o RAR offers the ability to create a multi-volume archive as SFX.

 o RAR offers a number of service functions, such as setting a
   password, adding archive and file comments.  Even physically
   damaged archives may be repaired and an archive may be locked
   to prevent further changes.  Authenticity information may be
   added for additional security and RAR will store information
   on the last update and name of the archive.

 o RAR provides ANSI esc-sequence support in comments.  This
   allows color comments and other ANSI features without the need
   for an ANSI-driver.
