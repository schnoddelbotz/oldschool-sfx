     This documents new or updated information since ARJ 2.41.


     ** IMPORTANT NEWS ****************************************************
 
        THIS VERSION OF ARJ IS AN OFFICIAL RELEASE.
 
        The mailing address of ARJ Software has changed as of August 1993.

        There is ARJ Internet mailing list and WEB site support
        information added to the file ARJ.DOC.

        Beginning with this version of ARJ, full functionality of certain
        ARJ software features will NOT be available in the shareware
        versions of ARJ (registered or not).  These features include the
        multiple volume self-extractor, the ARJSFX embedded command line
        feature, and the inhibit display messages option.  The full
        featured versions will ONLY be available from ARJ Software and
        its agents.  Registered ARJ users can upgrade to this version for
        a small shipping/handling fee ($5).

        See ARJDISP.DOC for information about a new feature for software
        distributors using ARJ.

        Check the WHATSNEW.DOC file for changes since ARJ 2.41a.

        The new multiple volume self-extraction function is LIMITED in the
        ARJ shareware version.  Only volumes of 360K or less in size can be
        created AND only such volumes will be processed by the
        self-extractor.  This feature is accessed through the "-je" option
        along with the "-v" option.

        The ARJ Security envelope scheme in 2.50 is the SAME as in 2.41.
        In other words, ARJ-SECURE 2.50 is compatible with 2.41.  There is
        no change in the envelope key files.  However, the 2.50 version
        of this ARJ-SECURE is able to make an archive and "seal" it with
        the same command line.  ARJ-SECURE users can upgrade to this
        version for a small shipping/handling fee ($5).

        ARJ can archive up to 32,000 files at one time when the new "-hm"
        option is specified.  This option enables ARJ to use disk space
        instead of memory space to manage the names of the files being
        archived.

        Please note that older versions of ARJ.EXE will NOT process the
        new multiple volume self-extractor.  An error message will be
        displayed.

        A new option "-w" sets the ARJSFX module to skip the "Continue
        extraction?" message.  This is a change from the former method to
        inhibit the message.

        The extraction messages of the large ARJSFX module have been
        shortened in default mode.  A new "-k" option will display the
        long form of the messages.

        It is now possible for registered ARJ users to control whether
        the ARJSFX module will display the overwrite, create directory,
        and continue extraction prompts without requiring command line
        options.  It is also possible to control the ARJSFXJR overwrite
        behavior.

        A diskette change test will detect the failure to swap diskettes.
        This can cause a problem for those who put more than one volume
        per diskette.  However, this diskette change test is limited to
        three retries, so ARJ will eventually accept the non-change of
        diskette.  The user can inhibit this change test with the new
        "-vi" option.

	Whenever archiving to diskettes, it is HIGHLY recommended that the
	option "-jt" be used.  This helps spot BAD diskettes or BAD
	diskette drives.  It is HIGHLY recommended that the "-jt" option
        be used in a Windows or multi-tasking or network environment.

	UNERASE or UNDELETE commands do not always recover a file
	correctly.  This will result in damaged archives.  This is true
	for all archive types.	You should always test an archive after
	unerasing it.

	If you use the software disk cache, HYPERDISK, see the KNOWN ARJ
	ISSUES section in ARJ.DOC for important information.

        CAUTION: To those who use the -t1 and/or -t1g options to save a few
        extra bytes.  This option should only be used on TEXT FILES. Those
        are files created by EDLIN, EDIT, QEDIT, BRIEF, NOTEPAD, and
        others.  Text files typically contain only letters, numbers,
        spaces, and punctuation marks.  WORD PROCESSOR format files ARE NOT
        TEXT FILES!  MS WORD, Wordperfect, AMIPRO, WRITE, and similar files
        ARE NOT TEXT FILES. Using the -t1 or -t1g on any other kind of file
        probably will result in DATA LOSS!

     **********************************************************************


     USER PROMPTS

	The ARJ user prompts have been improved to provide more
	flexibility.  In addition to the normal yes and no responses, ARJ
	also accepts the following responses: quit, always, skip, global,
	and command.

	"Global" sets ARJ to inhibit all subsequent user prompts by assuming
	YES for all queries as if "-y" were specified.

	The "Always" response has changed.  It now sets ARJ to assume YES
	for subsequent queries of the same class.  For example, answering
	YES to the overwrite query will assume YES for ALL subsequent
	overwrite queries.

	"Skip" sets ARJ to assume NO for ALL subsequent queries of the same
	class.

	Subsequent user prompt messages will still be output to the screen
	after the "always" and "skip" responses but no user response will be
	accepted.

	"Command" prompts for one DOS command and then executes it.  ARJ
	then returns to expect an answer to the current yes/no query.  You
	should keep the query in mind as ARJ does NOT always redisplay
	the full query message.


     ARJ ERROR LEVELS

	ARJ will now return a DOS errorlevel of 9 when trying to process a
	file that is NOT an ARJ archive.

	With the new option "-hl", ARJ will return a non-zero errorlevel
	when a user specified filename from within an ARJ listfile cannot
	be found on disk.  Ordinarily, ARJ returns no error for such a
	situation.


     ARJ ARCHIVE NAME WILDCARDING

	ARJ allows the wildcarding of the archive parameter for ARJ
	commands other than the add commands (a, f, j, m, u).  If the "-r"
	option is specified, ARJ will scan through subdirectories looking
	for ARJ archives to process.

	This feature allows a user to delete a specific file from a series
	of archives.

	Example:  ARJ d *.ARJ bbs.ad

	This feature could also be used to extract a series of archives.

	Example:  ARJ e *.ARJ

        The new "-hr" option allows ARJ to process multiple archives that
        cause errors.


     ARJ COMMAND LINE PROCESSING

        For non-add type commands, ARJ will now always use the full
        specified pathname for selecting files within an archive by
        matching against the full specified pathname.

        Example:  ARJ x archive d:\temp\ f:\data\1994\report.txt

        ARJ will now accept an ARJ command line from a response file as in
        "ARJ @command.rsp".  The "@" symbol indicates that the appended
        name is the name of the response file.  In this case, the file is
        command.rsp. The response file symbol cannot be changed.

        The response file should contain the ARJ command line minus the
        initial "ARJ".  The command line may be split over as many lines
        as necessary.  The response file feature will NOT accept QUOTED
        command line options.  Options with embedded blanks ("-vasTEST X")
        will not be processed as expected.  When using the response file
        feature, ARJ will accept only the "-+", and "-&" switch options on
        the DOS command line along with the response file name.  All other
        command options must be specified in the response file or in the
        ARJ environment variable.


     ARJSFX COMMAND LINE PROCESSING

        All of the ARJ self-extractors feature a new option to embed any
        command line options into the self-extracting archive itself.  This
        helps reduce the need for extra programs or batch files.

        To implement this feature, you would insert the required command
        line as the first line of the ARJ archive comment.  The beginning
        of the command line must be preceded by the two characters "))".
        Only the first 80 characters of the embedded command line will
        be processed.

        Example:  )) C:\DIR\ -o -m

        The non-shareware version of this software will not display the
        customized command line demonstration message.

        The larger ARJ self-extractor (-je) supports the new command line
        option "-s" to allow the skipping of the ARJ-SECURITY envelope
        verification test if an envelope exists.  ARJSFX also supports the
        new "-o" option to force overwrites, the "-m" option to skip the
        create directory prompt, and the "-w" option to skip the extract
        prompt.  The new "-b" option prompts the user for the name of the
        install directory.  The target directory on the command line is
        used as the default install directory.  A new "-k" option will
        display the long form of the file extraction messages.


     ARJSFXJR COMMAND LINE PROCESSING

	The small ARJ self-extractor (-je1) supports command line
	options.

	ARJSFXJR [-switch(es)] [drive:][target_dir\]

	switches:
	n: set ARJSFXJR to NOT count as an error the skipping of files
	o: set ARJSFXJR to overwrite existing files

	You can specify a target_directory or drive or both.  However,
	you must specify the ending "\" or ":" symbol.

	ARJSFXJR -o C:\SOFT\  -> self-extract into directory "C:\SOFT\"
				 in overwrite mode.


     ARJ COMMANDS

     "d" command

        *** The following information was left out of ARJ.DOC at 2.41 ***

        If specify "*.*" as the filespec, ARJ will prompt for permission to
	delete.  You can specify the "-y" or "-jyd" options to inhibit the
	delete prompt.

	If ARJ removes all files from an archive, it will delete the empty
	archive.

	The delete command normally only deletes non-backup files.  You
	must specify the "-jg" option to select backup files, too.

	You can specify the "-n" (new) option to delete the files in the
	archive that DO NOT EXIST on the disk.	You can use the same "-n"
	option with "ARJ l" to list the files that DO NOT EXIST on the
        disk.  This is useful in synchronising an archive to a directory.

	Examples:  ARJ d archive *.* -n
                   ARJ l archive temp\ *.doc -n
		   ARJ d archive temp\ *.doc -n


     "f" and "u" commands

        As of 2.42c, when updating archives with the -jv option selected,
        ARJ will display a message for each file processed including
        files that have not been updated.  A message indicating that
        there has been "no change" will be displayed when no actual
        update of a file took place.


     ARJ SWITCHES

     "-b4" switch

        The "-b4" switch is used to set ARJ to NOT restore any file
        attribute bits and to reset the archive bit of files being
        extracted.  It is useful for easing the cleanup/deletion of
        temporarily extracted archive files as in a virus scanning process.


     "-b5" switch

        This switch used with the "e" or "x" commands sets ARJ to not
        restore any of the original file attributes bits.  However, the
        archive bit will be left set.


     "-f1" switch

        This switch used with the "e" or "x" commands sets ARJ to only
        extract OLDER files from the archive.


     "-u1" switch

        This switch used with the "e" and "x" commands causes ARJ to
        extract OLDER and non-existing files.


     "-u2" switch

        This switch used with the "e" and "x" commands causes ARJ to
        extract CHANGED (different date-time or different size) and
        non-existing files.


     "-v" switch

	When the multiple volume ARJ files to be used are located on drives
	with removable media (diskette drives, etc.), ARJ will ALWAYS
	PROMPT for the next diskette even with the "-y" option specified.
	However, you can suppress the next volume prompt with the "-jyv"
	option.  At DOS versions before 3.0, only drives A and B are
	considered removable.

	After the pause to change diskettes, ARJ will check to make sure
	that the diskette has been changed.  However, this check is limited
        to 3 retries for the same volume.  This test can be inhibited with
        the "i" modifier.

        Example:  ARJ x a:archive -vi

	ARJ will not allow the updating of multiple volume archives unless
	the "-hu" option is specified.

	The "r" modifier allows the reservation of disk space on the first
	volume.  The number after the "r" specifies the space to reserve.
	This is useful for software installation volumes built on the hard
	disk.

	Example:  ARJ a install -v360r50K   make first volume 50000 bytes
					    smaller than 360K.

	Example:  ARJ u archive -v360u

	The "z" modifier works like the "s" modifier except that the system
	command is NOT echoed to the screen.

	The "-v" switch now accepts its modifiers in any order.  The "s"
	and "z" modifiers must be last because any succeeding text is
	considered the system command to execute.

	Examples:  ARJ a volume -vavw	     beep, autosize, whole files
		   ARJ a volume -vavsDIR     beep, autosize, execute DIR


     "-je" switch

        This switch will create a multiple volume self-extracting archive
        when used with the "-v" switch.  This option combination requires
        DOS 3.0 and above.

        Example:  ARJ a a:install c:\software\*.* -je -va


     "-jf" switch

        It is now possible to extract a file stored with an absolute path
        to another directory from an archive containing similar paths
        differentiated only by drive letters.

        Example: ARJ x archive d:\temp f:\data\1994\report.*


     "-js" switch

        The "-js" switch will recognize "." alone as a file extension
        indicating no file extension as in "-js." and "-js..arc"


     "-jv" switch

        The "-jv switch will display a "no change" message when updating
        an archive with files that are already up to date.


     "-h#" switch

        The "-h#" switch sets ARJ to append the current date string in
        the form YYMMDD to the current archive name while keeping the
        file extension the same.

        The "-h#1" switch sets ARJ to append the current time string in
        the form HHMMSS to the current archive name while keeping the
        file extension the same.

        The "-h#2" switch sets ARJ to append the current date-time
        string in the form DHHMMSS to the current archive name while
        keeping the file extension the same.

        Examples:  ARJ a XX -h# *.c    creates archive name XX931209.ARJ
                   ARJ a YY -h#1       creates archive name YY123000.ARJ
                   ARJ a Y -h#2        creates archive name Y8123000.ARJ

        This function does NO checking for exceeding the proper filename
        length.


     "-hm" switch

        The "-hm" switch sets ARJ to transfer the list of filenames to be
        archived from precious memory to file storage.  This allows a much
        larger number of files to be processed (over 32,000).  This option
        is ignored for all ARJ commands except "a", "f", "j", "m", "u".

        Normally, this switch sets ARJ to wait until it is out of memory
        storing filenames into a list before transferring that list to a
        temporary file.  That temporary file is put in the current
        directory or the special work directory if specified (-hm!F:\).
        However, there may be a few cases where ARJ will run out of memory
        doing other tasks while it is storing this list.  In these cases,
        ARJ will abort.  The user can specify a numeric argument to this
        switch to force ARJ to transfer the list to file storage sooner.
        This argument specifies the maximum number of filename entries to
        store in memory.  If the list exceeds that number, the entries are
        transferred from memory to a temporary file.

        The "-hm" work directory is specified by appending a "!" to the
        "-hm" or "-hm5000" options and then appending the filename to the
        option.  See below.

        Examples:  ARJ a archive c:\*.* -r -hm
                   ARJ a a:archive c:\*.* -r -va -hm5000!F:\
                   ARJ a a:archive c:\*.* -r -hm!G:\temp\

        This feature has at least two disadvantages.  The checking for
        duplicate filename specifications may become disabled (ex: *.DOC
        and MANUAL.* duplicates MANUAL.DOC).  Updating archives will become
        slower.  Extra disk space is required for the temporary file list.
        The use of a RAMDISK directory will provide the fastest operation.


     "-hn" switch

        The "-hn" switch sets the filespec that does NOT match any file.
        The default filespec is "...".  However, on some systems like
        NOVELL, there is a valid filespec "...".  Since ARJ sometimes needs
        a filespec that is strictly a placeholder, this option should be
        used to specify some name that does not exist on disk.

        This option must be specified prior to any use of the non-matching
        filespec.  Setting it via the ARJ_SW variable is an excellent
        choice.

        Example:  ARJ e -hn#### archive #### -zcomment.txt
                  SET ARJ_SW=-hn####


     "-ho" switch

        The "-ho" switch used with the "e" or "x" extract commands allows
        file extraction based upon a text search.  ARJ will prompt the
        user for text strings to search unless the "-jq" option has been
        specified.  See the "-jq" option in ARJ.DOC for detailed use
        information.  ARJ will extract a file within an archive if the
        file contains at least one occurrence of any of the specified
        search strings.

        Examples:  ARJ e archive -ho
                   ARJ e archive -ho -jq+3+textstring


     "-ho1" switch

        The "-ho1" switch used with the "e" or "x" extract commands allows
        file extraction based upon a text search.  ARJ will prompt the
        user for text strings to search unless the "-jq" option has been
        specified.  See the "-jq" option in ARJ.DOC for detailed use
        information.  ARJ will extract a file within an archive if the
        file contain NO occurrences of any of the specified search
        strings.

        Examples:  ARJ e archive -ho1


     "-hr" switch

        The "-hr" switch sets ARJ to attempt to continue processing
        successive archives even when they contains errors.  This option is
        intended for ARJ wildcard use such as in the "ARJ t *.ARJ -hr"
        command.


     "-hv" switch

        The "-hv" switch is used to verify the ARJ version number and/or
        whether the ARJ program is registered.  If the "-hv" option is
        specified by itself or with an appended "R", an unregistered ARJ
        will abort with an errorlevel of 1.  If a version number string
        is appended to the "-hv" option, a lower version numbered ARJ
        will abort with with an errorlevel of 1.

        Examples:  ARJ a archive -hv         check if registered
                   ARJ a archive -hvr        check if registered
                   ARJ a archive -hv2.50     check for version 2.50 or greater
                   ARJ a archive -hvr2.50    check if registered and version
                                             2.50 or greater
