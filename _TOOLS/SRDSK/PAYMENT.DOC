
                    ReSizeable RAMDisk registration


        I grant you temporary license to use SRDISK 2.0 for evaluation 
        purposes for one month free of charge. After that you are 
        required to buy a license for your use of SRDISK.

        By bying the license, you will become a registered user and you 
        receive a registration key that can be installed into all 2.x 
        versions of SRDISK to disable the registration reminder.

        In the spirit of shareware, the cost of one license is 
        reasonable. Please, allow me to keep the cost low and support 
        development of SRDISK by registering.

        By registering you will also support shareware as the method of 
        selling software on try before buy basis. The only thing to keep 
        shareware going is the morality of people - also yours.


SINGLE USERS

        The cost of single license for SRDISK is US$12 or FIM 50.

        Some people have told me that I ask too little for the license. 
        Since the purpose of your payment is not only to pay for the 
        work I have done but also to support the future development of 
        SRDISK, you can contribute more than the US$12 if you feel 
        SRDISK is worth it.

        The US$12 is just the minimum to get the license to use SRDISK.


SITE LICENSES

        The cost of site license for SRDISK depends on the number of 
        computers you license SRDISK for.

          Computers     Price
              1-10      US$12 (FIM 50) per computer
             11-50      US$6 (FIM 25) per computer
             51-200     US$5 (FIM 20) per computer
            201-1000    US$3 (FIM 15) per computer
           1001-        US$2 (FIM 10) per computer (or mail me to ask)

        Read the table so, that the license for 10 first computers will
        cost $12 each. 40 computers after that $6 each etc. For example
        the payment for 100 computers will be

                 10 computers at $12 is $120
                 40 computers at  $6 is $240
                 50 computers at  $5 is $250
                ====================================
                                  total $610

        You can also try to bargain.


COVERAGE OF LICENSE

        The license will cover all versions 1.x and 2.x of SRDISK. 
        Depending on what the version 3.x will hold, it may or may not 
        be included in the license (will be noted in the version 3.x 
        documentation). If it is not included, I will continue to 
        support the 2.x versions that are covered by the license for 
        possible bug fixes for as long as someone reports bugs in it and 
        I still work on some later version of SRDISK.

        One license is valid for only one computer in which you use 
        SRDISK. If you wish to use SRDISK on another computer, you must 
        remove your registered SRDISK from the previous computer.

        The license is non-transferable.


UPDATE SERVICE

        Updates will be made available on some anonymous FTP sites 
        (Simtel, garbo.uwasa.fi). PC-SIG collection disk 3052 also holds 
        a copy of SRDISK, but it will not be updated very frequently. 
        Updated versions will be made available as need araises -- 
        either by bug reports or by requests for new features.

        If you want to receive newest versions on disk when they become 
        available, send me US$10 for each disk and the registration form 
        at the end of this file.

        Unregistered persons can order SRDISK on disk for US$20.


METHODS OF PAYMENT

- Cash

        Twelve dollars is such a small amount of money, that if you feel 
        secure sending it in cash please do so.

        Amounts over US$30 should be sent using the other methods.

- International Money Order

        The best method for you is propably International Money Order in
        US dollars. Finnish customers may wish to pay directly to my
        account.

        Small Money Orders are of terrible trouble to me (and my bank). 
        Also I do not know when they start to take the fee of about 
        US$12 for cashing them...

- Check

        Accepted, but not preferred. My bank accepts US checks, but they 
        are as difficult to cash as the Money Orders.

- SWIFT or directly to my account

        If you wish to use SWIFT or otherwise transfer the money
        directly to my bank account, my account is:

                Kansallis-Osake-Pankki
                Vantaa-Korso
                122135-11817
                SWIFT: KOPIFIHH

        Please make sure I can get your name, proper surface mail
        address and what you are buying the license for (version of it
        too) and for how many computers it is from the receipt.

        You should also mail me a copy of your receipt of payment with
        the registration form. That way you can be certain I get all the
        necessary information about you.


WHAT THEN?

        You will receive your certificate of license in about 2 to 8
        weeks after I receive your payment - depending on how far you
        are - with the registration key.

        If you think you do not need the paper to prove your license and 
        you have an email address, please check the "Reply via Email" 
        box in the form. Email is usually much faster than surface mail.

        For further information (and if you want to bargain) my Internet 
        email address is Marko.Kohtala@compart.fi. If you think you do 
        not have internet email access, please check your local BBSes: 
        you can mail to me from FidoNet and many other nets.


        Mail me the registration form below with your International 
        Money Order or copy of your receipt of payment.

        Please, use your (or company's) full name, since the name will 
        be needed with the registration key.
