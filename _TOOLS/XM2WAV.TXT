                         =========================

Warning:
--------
IF YOU DON'T USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK,
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT !!!
You may copy it freely.

Features:
---------
-Converts XM's to 16 bit stereo WAV's
-High compatibility to FT2
-Anti click algorithm
-Four point (spline) interpolation to reduce sampling artifacts
-NEW: Envelope interpolation
-Built-in player for GUS, IW, SB and AWE
-Dumb Memory Management system (DMM) for GUS, IW and AWE
 (plays instead of complaining or crashing :-)

Usage:
------
xm2wav [parameters]

General parameters:
xmname.xm          : XM-name, wildcarts possible (default: *.xm)
-vx                : Amplification (1 - 32, default: 12, FT2 compatible)
Convert parameters:
-c                 : Convert (high quality)
-cf                : Fast convert (less quality)
-rx                : Convert rate (8000 - 48000, default: 44100)
Play parameters:
-8                 : SB16 : play in 8 bit mode
-m                 : SB16, SBPro : play mono 8 bit
-h                 : SB: play with halve mixing rate
-1                 : SB: play in DSP 1.xx mode
-o                 : AWE: play in SB mode, IW: play in GUS mode (old mode)

Examples:
---------
xm2wav -c -r48000       : Convert all XM's in current directory with 48kHz
xm2wav strangle.xm -cf  : Convert strangle.xm in fast mode
xm2wav strangle.xm -v16 : Play strangle.xm louder than default

Comments:
---------
A long time there was no xm to wav converter available with the quality
needed to burn xm's on cd-rom. This is why I made this one. Thanks go to
Jeroen Tel for strangle.xm, which was the best xm to test the quality of
the converter. But finally FT 2.08 came out with a really good diskwriter.
It nearly makes this converter obsolete, but it does not contain spline
interpolation. So I continue to keep my converter up to date. The FT 2
diskwriter also made it possible to find out the correct formula for
converting the panning into a right/left volume. I also added and improved
the envelope interpolation. If there are set volume commands, FT 2 misses
to interpolate the envelope. This feature also works on slide commands
like Axx.

The fast mode (-cf) uses the SB16 mixing routine while converting. It only
provides the anti click algorithm.

Make sure that the xm to convert does not contain an endless pattern loop.

SBPro: stereo can be reversed
AWE: the effects engine is not initialized by the player
     the -vx option does not have any effect

Two effects are missing: set glissando control and set finetune.
Just tell me if you need them.

Hints for optimal use of your memory on the IW (GUS-PNP): If you have two
memory modules of different size insert the bigger one into the first slot.
If you have at least one 4M module and your card has 512k on-board, don't
forget to change the jumper setting.

 256k and 1M modules             at least one 4M module

With no RAM on-board don't change the jumpers.
